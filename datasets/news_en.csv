1,"Italy budget concession hopes switch risk sentiment back on, boost euro","The euro bounced off six-week lows on Wednesday, European shares rose and Italian bonds rallied as some of the worries that have rippled across markets this week were soothed by signs Rome was amenable to cutting budget deficits and debt in coming years. FILE PHOTO: A man looks at an electronic board displaying stock index outside a bank in downtown Milan June 13, 2013. REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo A report in the Corriere della Serra newspaper — later confirmed to Reuters by a government source — said the deficit would fall to 2.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and to 2 percent in 2021 from the 2.4 percent earlier outlined.   That brought relief to markets which had fretted that Italy’s decision to expand budget deficits well beyond what was agreed by a previous government would deepen its debt problems while stoking conflict with the European Union, whose officials have already expressed concerns. The euro, which had hit a six-week trough of $1.1506 after suffering five straight days of losses, firmed 0.3 percent while Italian borrowing costs eased off 4-1/2-year highs, after jumping 50 basis points since budget details emerged last Thursday.  Two-year yields fell 15 bps. (GRAPHIC: Italy's 2-year bond yield: absolute change - reut.rs/2QqI0NN)  “It’s all about Italy today. The news about a possible reduction in budget deficits has been positively taken by all markets, and the euro is back up too — that’s the main risk parameter for euro crisis concerns,” said Bernd Berg, global macro and FX strategist at Woodman Asset Management in Zurich. A pan-European equity index opened a quarter percent higher, while the Milan bourse jumped more than one percent. The moves were led by an initial 3.1 percent bounce in Italian banks. The banks’ huge government debt holdings make them particularly vulnerable to bond selloffs and has pressured Italian stock markets for months. (GRAPHIC: Italian stocks lag Europe - reut.rs/2QpHsbe)  The moves pushed down the premium investors demand for holding Italian risk relative to that of safer Germany to around 290 bps, down from a five-year high over 300 bps on Tuesday and sapped some demand for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the dollar and Swiss franc. The euro jumped half a percent to the franc and 0.4 percent to the yen. Analysts noted however that other southern European markets, Spain and Portugal, which were caught up in Greece’s 2010-2011 crisis, had been resilient to spillover from Italy this year.  “Contagion has been far more subdued than in the past and that’s an important signal. I expect policymakers to latch on to that as proof (Italy’s crisis) is self-imposed and not a reflection of what’s happening as a whole in the weaker (euro zone) countries,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier in London. He added that Italy’s high yields — two-year bonds there pay 1.3 percent versus zero in Portugal — were also enticing some investors.  Wall Street too appeared set for a firmer open, with futures for the S&P 500 the Dow up around 0.2 percent. Broader world market sentiment remains jittery though, partly because of the bellicose rhetoric still emerging from the coalition government in Rome, but also due to fears that a Sino-U.S. tariff row would escalate once China reopens after a week-long holiday. While U.S. President Donald Trump agreed a new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, a controversial clause in the trilateral agreement, forbidding similar deals with “non-market” countries, was seen as raising risks for Sino-U.S. talks.   Volatility in U.S. tech shares is also making investors wary, with Facebook down almost 6 percent in the past three sessions after disclosing its worst security breach ever.  World shares were flat near two-week lows while MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.7 percent lower.  China’s financial markets are closed and will resume trade on Oct. 8. That’s the day Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend G-20 meetings, meaning news could emerge on the trade front. The dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of major currencies, pulled back from six-week highs of 95.744.   Emerging currencies derived some relief from the weaker dollar but the Indian rupee hit a new record low and the Indonesian rupiah touched a more than 20-year low, as oil prices near four-year highs weighed on importing nations’ finances. Indonesian authorities stepped in to support the currency and India is expected to raise interest rates this Friday. Turkey’s lira also weakened one percent to the dollar as the country, another oil importer, posted data showing inflation at more than 25 percent. That increases pressure on the central bank to raise rates again after a whopping 625 bps move in August. Woodman Asset Management’s Berg said however the worst looked to be over for Turkey, adding: “the currency has appreciated and the central bank has hiked rates aggressively so...toward the end of the year, inflation numbers should stabilize and to me, the worst of the currency crisis is over.” Brent crude inched up to $84.89 per barrel, close to four-year highs of $85.45 touched earlier this week.

2,"Indonesia's Widodo says aid gearing up, worry grows about cut-off areas","Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo made a second visit to Sulawesi island on Wednesday to ramp up relief efforts following a devastating earthquake and tsunami, as survivors pleaded for water, food and fuel five days after the disaster struck. The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the west coast of Sulawesi last Friday rose to 1,407, many killed by tsunami waves it triggered. But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down, and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides. Underlining a growing sense of urgency, Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed hotel in Palu. “What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters. National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said most of the aid effort had been concentrated in Palu, where electricity supply has still to be restored. Verwandte ThemenIndonesian disaster raises risks for President Widodo as he eyes re-electionBut rescue workers have begun to reach more remote areas in a disaster zone that encompasses 1.4 million people. Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, a district of 300,000 people, which includes towns strung along a coast road north of Palu close to the quake’s epicenter.      “Everyone is desperate for food and water. There’s no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,” Gogali said, adding that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike.   GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo AID LANDS IN PALU Yahdi Basma, a leader from a village south of Palu hoping to get his family on a cargo plane out, said Widodo had no idea of the extent of the suffering. “The president is not hearing about the remote areas, only about the tsunami and about Palu,” he said. “There are hundreds of people still buried under the mud in my village. I lost many members of my family and neighbors. There is no aid whatsoever which is why we’re leaving.” A mother and her son, both injured by the earthquake and tsunami, wait to be airlifted out by a military plane at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, October 3, 2018. REUTERS/Athit PerawongmethaWidodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found. He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins. At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”. The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, about 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted early on Wednesday but there were no reports of any casualties or damage. Ash was not expected to disrupt flights.  Nugroho said aircraft, tents, water treatment facilities and generators were the main needs for survivors including more than 70,000 displaced people. Police have done little to stop outbreaks of looting. The government has played down the problem, saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated. The government has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when two major earthquakes struck Lombok island, south of Sulawesi.

U.S. President Donald Trump extended condolences in a phone call with Widodo, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters in Washington. The United States has provided initial funding, deployed government disaster experts and was working to determine what other help can be given, she said. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters

5,Aston Martin skids on market debut,"Shares in luxury automaker Aston Martin (AML.L) fell as much as 6.5 percent in its market debut in London on Wednesday after investors and analysts raised concerns that it may find it hard to deliver on an ambitious roll-out of new models.   The company, which last year made its first profit since 2010 and has gone bankrupt seven times, had priced its shares at 19 pounds each, giving it a market capitalization of 4.33 billion pounds  ($5.63 billion).  The shares fell to as low as 17.75 pounds and were down 3.16 percent at 0759 GMT. Aston Martin had initially set a range of 17.50 pounds to 22.50 pounds per share, but on Monday narrowed this to 18.50 to 20 pounds saying it had sufficient bid interest to cover all the shares being sold. Verwandte ThemenAston Martin shares open flat at 19 pounds per share in London debutInvestors and analysts were concerned, however, about the execution risk related to its plans for rolling out new models: Aston Martin plans to launch a new core model every year from to 2022. “Aston Martin has very aggressive growth plans. The execution of that growth needs to be flawless - nothing eats cash more than a car company when the cycle turns. There is concern that it’s more cyclical than the commentary has been,” said James Congdon, managing director of cashflow returns specialist Quest. “The banks have done a good job for their client - but there’s no bounce.”  VALUATION In 2017, Aston Martin had adjusted earnings before tax interest, depreciation and amortization of 206.5 million pounds, up from 100.9 million pounds in 2016. Slideshow (2 Images)Aston Martin’s closest comparable is Ferrari (RACE.MI) which listed in 2015 and trades with an enterprise value of 22.2 times EBITDA, according to Refinitiv data.  Based on this metric and Aston Martin’s net debt of 538.8 million pounds, the British carmaker looked slightly expensive in its debut - pricing at 23.6 times EBITDA.        Depending on its price performance, Aston Martin might just make it into the FTSE 100 .FTSE - the first carmaker in Britain's blue-chip index since Jaguar.  Its shareholders, which include Italian investment firm Investindustrial and a group of Kuwait-based investors, sold a quarter of its existing stock and is not raising any new money - meaning no funds will be plowed into the firm as a direct result of the listing.  Aston Martin’s poor debut is the latest blow to Europe’s cautious IPO market.  British crowd-lending platform Funding Circle (FCH.L) is down more than 20 percent since it floated last week - denting the London Stock Exchange’s hope of becoming an attractive listing destination for technology companies worth more than $1 billion.

6,"North, South Korea begin removing landmines along fortified border","Troops from North and South Korea began removing some landmines along their heavily fortified border on Monday, the South’s defense ministry said, in a pact to reduce tension and build trust on the divided peninsula. Project details were agreed during last month’s summit in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. In a statement, the ministry said the two sides agreed to remove all landmines in the so-called Joint Security Area (JSA) in Panmunjom within the next 20 days, with military engineers performing the hazardous task on the South Korean side. There was no immediate confirmation from North Korea that its troops had begun the process. The deal also provides for removal of guard posts and weapons from the JSA to follow the removal of the mines, with the troops remaining there to be left unarmed. The JSA is the only spot along the 250-km (155-mile) -long “demilitarized zone” (DMZ) where troops from both Koreas are face to face. South Korean troops have gradually taken over most operations along their side of the border but international forces under the U.S.-led United Nations Command retain major roles, especially at the JSA, where an American commander and a South Korean deputy lead the security battalion. UNC spokesman Colonel Chad Carroll declined to confirm if the command would also withdraw any weapons from the JSA, but said American forces would provide support for the demining operation. “United States Forces Korea will perform a support role - to include having air medical evacuation assets available to respond within minutes of any potential medical emergencies,” he told Reuters in a statement. Since fighting during the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in a stalemate, at least nine soldiers have been killed in incidents with North Korean troops, including the killing in 1976 of two U.S. soldiers by axe-wielding North Koreans, the UNC says. In November 2017, North Korean troops at the JSA shot one of their soldiers defecting to the South five times.  More recently, it was the scene of the first dramatic April summit between Kim and Moon, as well as their second, more low-key meeting, in May. In April, the neighbors announced their intention to turn the DMZ - long a symbol of tension and division - into a “peace zone”. They have already dismantled propaganda loudspeakers and some guard posts along the border. Demining projects are also set to begin on Monday in Gangwon province in South Korea’s east, to allow teams to search for the remains of soldiers killed in the war, the ministry added.  More than a million landmines were laid in border areas including the DMZ and the Civilian Control Zone in the South, say demining experts, and civilians and soldiers alike have been killed or injured by them.  In 2015, two South Korean soldiers were maimed by what Seoul said was a North Korean landmine, an accusation the North denied.

7,"Woman sues Facebook, claims site enabled sex trafficking","A Texas woman, claiming that she was raped, beaten and sex trafficked at the age of 15 by a pimp who posed as a Facebook “friend,” has filed suit against the social network, alleging its executives knew minors were being lured into the sex trade on their platform. The Facebook logo is displayed on their website in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau  The woman, identified only as Jane Doe in court papers filed in Harris County District Court in Houston on Monday, also named as defendants the now-shuttered classified ads website Backpage.com and its founders. Facebook did not respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Attorneys for Backpage.com and the former employees named in the lawsuit as defendants also did not return calls for comment. According to the lawsuit, the woman was “friended” on Facebook in 2012 by a user who appeared to know several of her real-life friends. The man messaged her through Facebook, according to the lawsuit, which was seen by Reuters.  The lawsuit alleges that at one point following an argument with her mother, the trafficker offered to console her, but after picking her up from her home he beat and raped her and took pictures that were posted on Backpage.com. The lawsuit says Facebook did not do enough to verify the user’s identity, which the lawsuit said was false, and that Jane Doe was never warned that sex traffickers were operating on the social media network. The plaintiff’s attorneys, David Harris and Louie Cook of the law firm Sico Hoelscher Harris LLP in Houston, did not reply to requests for comment.Backpage.com was shut down by authorities earlier this year after a Justice Department investigation into allegations that the website was used primarily to sell sex.

8,Impatient patients turn to online 'buyers club' for new drugs,"Frustrated by delays in new medicines reaching their own country, a small but growing number of patients are turning to an online broker that bills itself as a legal version of the Dallas Buyers Club. FILE PHOTO: Pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are arranged on a table in this picture illustration taken in Ljubljana August 20, 2014.   REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic/File PhotoWhile regulators warn of the risk of buying drugs online, the Amsterdam-based Social Medwork sees its network of trusted suppliers as filling a gap in the market for the latest drugs against diseases such as cancer, migraine and multiple sclerosis. Now it is looking to raise its profile and expand, by signing up former EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes to its supervisory board and securing 1.5 million euros ($1.73 million) in new funding from the Social Impact Ventures capital fund. Like Ron Woodroof, the 1980s AIDS patient in the movie ‘Dallas Buyers Club’, patients who cannot get the drugs they want through local healthcare systems are using the organization to self-import medicines from abroad. But while Woodroof had to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border, the Social Medwork’s customers can place orders online legally, as long as they have a prescription and a doctor’s letter stating that the drug is strictly for personal use. In the past 18 months, the group, which is registered with the Dutch Ministry of Health as a medicines intermediary, has supplied more than 3,000 patients. They include British migraine sufferer Senty Bera, 43, who recently used the system to buy Aimovig, a new monthly migraine injection from Amgen and Novartis, the first in an improved class of drugs that target a chemical involved in triggering attacks. “My quality of life was so poor I thought it was worth trying and it is working brilliantly,” Bera said. FILE PHOTO: Pharmaceutical tablets and capsules in foil strips are arranged on a table in this picture illustration taken in Ljubljana August 20, 2014. REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic/File PhotoAs yet, Aimovig is not approved for use within Britain’s state health service - though Bera hopes it will be soon - but its reputation means it is one of Social Medwork’s top-sellers, despite a price tag of 698 euros for two autoinjectors. A spokeswoman for Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed there were no formal restrictions on importing such medicines for personal use. In the past, informal drug-buying networks here have helped supply cheap generic versions of treatments for HIV and hepatitis C. But the Dutch group, which charges a fee of around 6 percent, claims to be the only organization focused on newly approved branded drugs. With customers in 70 countries, its line-up includes new cancer drugs that are U.S.-approved but not yet available elsewhere, as well as medicines for chronic disorders, such as Roche’s new multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus. Founder Sjaak Vink says the Internet means patients are increasingly aware they may be waiting months or even years for novel drugs following a first approval elsewhere. “We really need to bridge this gap because this situation is ridiculous,” he said in an interview. Vink said he was inspired to found the organization by delays in European availability of Merck & Co’s  innovative cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Today, his group has customers in Australia, the Middle East and Asia, as well as major European markets such as France, Italy, Germany and Britain, where drug delays could worsen if Brexit disrupts supply lines. Given relatively speedy U.S. approvals, there are currently fewer customers in America, although there was a spike in U.S. demand last year for Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma’s amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug Radicut/Radicava, which was approved first in Japan.

9,Indonesian disaster raises risks for President Widodo as he eyes re-election,"Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami could raise political risks for President Joko Widodo as he prepares a bid for re-election next year, with opponents keen to find fault in his handling of the disaster in a region with a history sectarian strife. A portrait of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo is seen on a collapsed structure after an earthquake and tsunami hit in Palu, Central Sulawesi. Antara Foto/Muhammad Adimaja/ via REUTERSThe official death toll from the Friday’s 7.5 quake and tsunami that struck the west coast of Sulawesi island has surged to 1,407 but there are fears it will rise when the full scale of destruction is determined and the missing are accounted for. Widodo, a former furniture businessman and the first president to come from outside the political or military establishment, will seek another five-year term in the April 17 election. A quietly spoken reformer, he has enjoyed strong popularity but faces hostility from conservative nationalist and Islamist forces in the predominantly Muslim country of 260 million people. Widodo was quick to visit the badly hit city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta less than two days after the quake, urging residents to be patient.  He made another visit on Wednesday, underlining the urgency of the rescue effort, as frustration about a lack of food, fuel and equipment mounted. “Any failure to handle it properly is not going to go down well,” Keith Loveard a senior analyst with advisory and risk firm Concord Consulting, told Reuters, speaking before Widodo made his second visit. “It’s still got to be managed and the next few days will be critical.” The government has left itself open to criticism for failing to maintain a tsunami warning system set up after a 2004 quake and tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries around the Indian Ocean, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. The system has been out of action since 2012. Widodo, who came to power in 2014, said on Tuesday it had to be repaired and properly maintained. With growing desperation and outbreaks of looting among survivors and questions over the aid effort, opposition politicians have been sharpening their knives. An announcement by the interior minister, Tjahjo Kumolo, that survivors could take essentials from shops and the government would later compensate them, has been criticized as giving a green light to lawlessness. “In a complex emergency, what is needed is leadership and law and order. At this stage, the government is very weak,” Fadli Zon, deputy speaker of parliament from the opposition nationalist Gerindra party, said on Twitter. Widodo’s main challenger next year, Prabowo Subianto, is head of the Gerindra party.  ‘TARGET’ Widodo narrowly defeated Subianto in the last election in 2014 and Subianto will be looking for any opportunity to damage Widodo now. “If Widodo pulls off a really good emergency relief effort he won’t give Prabowo a target to strike,” said Achmad Sukarsono of the Control Risks consultancy. “At the moment, we haven’t seen that so it’s fair game for a challenger to attack.” Widodo also has to tip-toe around sensitivities over the issue of foreign aid in a country with a proud history of resistance to colonial rule, where governments have been loath to go cap in hand to outsiders. Widodo risks angering either nationalists, by being seen as too ready to take outside help, or many ordinary members of the public, by hesitating to accept aid that could save lives. The government shunned outside help this year when earthquakes struck the island of Lombok. But it said on Monday it would accept foreign aid for Sulawesi. Given the urgency in Sulawesi, even government critics begrudgingly agree outside help is needed, although one, Sodik Mudjahid, another senior member of Gerindra, added a word of warning: “We should not commit to anything that will hurt our sovereignty,” Mudjahid told Reuters. Complicating the job for the government is a long history of bloodshed in Sulawesi between Muslims, who are a majority in Indonesia, and Christians. An estimated 2,000 people were killed in three years of clashes in the region before a peace accord took effect in 2001. Palu was hit by bombings in 2005, believed to have been part of a campaign to re-ignite tension. In the longer term, anger among people who feel deprived of aid could be manipulated. “You’ve got a very polarized community,” Loveard said.  ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-03 00:00:00,Reuters

11,New York Times says Trump helped parents shield millions from taxes,"U.S. President Donald Trump engaged in tax schemes that included cases of fraud in which he and his siblings helped their parents dodge millions of dollars in taxes, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. The Times investigation, which the White House said was “misleading,” showed Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father’s real estate business.  The Times, citing a “vast trove” of confidential tax returns and financial records, reported that much of that fortune came to Trump because he helped his parents evade taxes, setting up a fake corporation with his siblings to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents.  Trump promoted himself during his presidential campaign as a self-made real estate mogul who started out with only a “very small” loan from his businessman father, Fred Trump. Reuters has not been able to verify the report. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the story “misleading” and said in a statement “many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions.” Trump’s lawyer Charles Harder told the Times: “President Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters.” “The affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law,” Harder said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter late on Tuesday: “I’ve directed NYC’s Department of Finance to immediately investigate tax and housing violations and to work with NY State to find out if appropriate taxes were paid.” James Gazzale, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, said earlier the department “is reviewing the allegations in the New York Times article and is vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation.” The U.S. Internal Revenue Service did not reply immediately to a request for comment. The Times, citing tax experts, reported it was unlikely Trump would face criminal prosecution because the acts were past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud, according to the paper. It reported that its findings were based on more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. The records did not include Donald Trump’s personal tax returns. Unlike other White House candidates and presidents in recent decades, Trump has declined to release his tax returns. The Times said the report was also based on interviews with Fred Trump’s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings of his business empire. “The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records - bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks,” it said.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh becomes emotional as he testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2018. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File PhotoUnder pressure, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI investigation following a dramatic Senate hearing last week in which university professor Christine Blasey Ford detailed a sexual assault she says was carried out by Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, at a high school party in 1982. However, the White House gave the FBI a deadline of Friday to provide the results of a week-long inquiry into the allegations - all of which Kavanaugh has vehemently denied.  The FBI has already interviewed Judge, who has denied any memory of such an incident, as well as at least three other people with information about the allegations made by Ford and a second accuser, Deborah Ramirez. Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when they both attended Yale University. Ford’s lawyers said on Tuesday she had offered her full cooperation with the FBI in its investigation but had received no reply.  “It is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Ford’s allegations without interviewing her, Judge Kavanaugh, or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to you,” the lawyers said in their letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray. A person familiar with the matter said the FBI questioned Deborah Ramirez for more than two hours on Sunday and that she provided the FBI with a list of more than 20 possible witnesses. Richard Oh, a classmate of Ramirez and Kavanaugh at Yale, told Reuters he contacted the FBI’s Denver field office twice at the weekend hoping to provide information he believed would support Ramirez’s account. Oh said it was unclear if the person he spoke with at the FBI passed on his statement to agents working on the case.  “I didn’t get the sense that this person even knew what the Kavanaugh case was about,” said Oh, an emergency room doctor in California. “I was hoping to hear back from them for follow-up questions. I still haven’t heard from them.” ‘NOBODY CONTACTED’ Mark Krasberg, who lived in the same dormitory as Kavanaugh at Yale, said he had also been unsuccessful in connecting with the right people at the FBI despite efforts to provide “information which backs up part of Debbie Ramirez’s story.” Those efforts included calling the FBI’s Denver field office, which he chose because it is Ramirez’s home state, and several emails with Senate aides starting on Friday, Krasberg said. Jo Miller, who has spoken out in support of Ramirez, noted that two other Yale classmates of Kavanaugh - Tad Low and Kerry Berchem - had also sought to contact FBI agents working on the case without success. “As far as I can tell nobody has been contacted,” Miller said. The claims are significant because Democrats in the U.S. Senate will likely complain that the FBI was not given enough time to complete a proper investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. Republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate and Trump and party leaders want to get Kavanaugh confirmed ahead of  Nov. 6 elections, in which Democrats are trying to seize control of Congress. The stakes are high because Kavanaugh’s confirmation would consolidate conservative control of the Supreme Court. Three moderate Republicans have yet to say if they will back Kavanaugh and they will likely be the key votes when the Senate finally decides. Trump raised the temperature even further at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night, mocking Ford for not having answers to some questions during her Senate testimony.  “What neighborhood was it in? I don’t know. Where’s the house? I don’t know. Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don’t know. But I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember,” Trump said in imitation of Ford’s testimony. He also drew criticism from Democrats earlier on Tuesday by saying the Kavanaugh case showed it was “a very scary time for young men in America” because they might be presumed guilty even when innocent.

14,Asia shares slip; euro rebounds as reports temper Italian debt fears,"Asian shares slipped on Wednesday as oil prices near four-year highs threatened to roil emerging economies, while the euro rebounded from six-week lows on reports Italy will reduce its budget deficit more quickly than expected. FILE PHOTO: A man looks at a mobile phone next to an electronic board showing Japan's Nikkei average outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, March 23, 2018.  REUTERS/Toru HanaiSpreadbetters pointed to a firm start for the European markets amid hopes Rome could stave off a debt blow-out. E-Minis for the S&P 500 and the Dow were up 0.1 percent,  while E-Stoxx 50 added 0.2 percent. The euro was boosted by a report published by the Corriere Della Sera newspaper, saying Italy would reduce its budget deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2021. The report came after the coalition government said last week that it planned to run a deficit of 2.4 percent over the next three years, in a move that tripled the previous target and worried investors in both Italy and the European Union.     “The big market mover in the last 24 hours has been Italy and the concerns around its debt so the latest news is being considered a much better outcome than was priced into the market,” said Kyle Roda, Melbourne-based analyst at IG. “The news has prompted some buying, we’re seeing a bit of a relief rally.” The euro jumped 0.3 percent on the news to $1.1585, snapping five straight days of losses that had pushed it to a six-week trough of $1.1506.   Italian BTP futures opened 98 ticks higher while German Bund Futures slipped as the spread between the two narrowed. Sentiment in Asia remained jittery in Asia as investors considered how a new trade pact between the United States,  Mexico and Canada could impact the ongoing U.S.-Sino tariff warm as it contained a clause forbidding deals with non-market countries, like China.   MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index down 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.7 percent lower while Indonesian shares fell 0.4 percent and India’s Nifty 50 faltered 0.8 percent. China’s financial markets are closed for the National Day holiday and will resume trade on Oct. 8. South Korea was also closed for a public holiday.  Chinese markets have been hammered this year as investors worry that the trade row with the United States could crimp economic growth. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 95.343, pulling back from six-week highs of 95.744 set on Tuesday.   Gold traded near its highest level in more than a week as investors sought refuge in the safe haven asset after equity markets weakened. Spot gold was last at 1,204.79 after adding 1.3 percent to $1,208.23 an ounce overnight. Oil prices held close to four-year highs on supply worries due to Washington’s sanctions on Iran.  The firmer oil has hit the Indian rupee and Indonesia’s rupiah as the two nations import most of their oil and are heavily exposed to fluctuations in oil prices and the U.S. dollar. Brent rose 7 cents to $84.87 per barrel, not far from a four-year high of $85.45 touched earlier in the week. U.S. crude inched 9 cent up to $75.32 a barrel, after earlier touching a four-year high of $75.91.

15,Chinese movie star Fan Bingbing hit with huge tax evasion fines,"China has ordered A-list movie star Fan Bingbing to pay about 884 million yuan ($129 million) in overdue taxes and fines, state news agency Xinhua said on Wednesday, as a crackdown on tax evasion in the entertainment industry gathers momentum. FILE PHOTO: 71st Cannes Film Festival - Screening of the film ""Ash Is Purest White"" (Jiang hu er nv) in competition - Red Carpet Arrivals - Cannes, France, May 11, 2018. Fan Bingbing poses. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File PhotoThe 37-year-old actor, whose June disappearance touched off wild speculation about her whereabouts, has appeared in the “X-Men” and “Iron Man” film franchises, attracting more than 62 million online followers in China. Xinhua said an investigation by Chinese tax authorities found Fan had split her contract to evade taxes of 7.3 million yuan ($1.1 million) over payments for her role in “Air Strike”, a film due to be released this year. Fan and companies she represented also evaded 248 million yuan ($36 million) in additional taxes, Xinhua said, but it gave no details regarding this figure. The tax bureau in the eastern coastal province of Jiangsu delivered its judgment to Fan on Sunday, levying fines of more than 596 million yuan ($86.7 million) for tax evasion and assessing overdue taxes of more than 288 million yuan ($42 million), Xinhua said. In a letter posted on her official account on the Twitter-like platform Weibo, Fan said she fully accepted the authorities’ decision, would overcome “all difficulties” to pay the penalties, and step up supervision of her companies. “I’m ashamed of my behavior and I apologize here to everyone,” Fan wrote. “Every bit of my achievement is inseparable from the support of the state and the people. Without the good policies of the Communist Party and the state, without the love of the people, there is no Fan Bingbing.” Xinhua said that under Chinese law Fan, as a first-time offender, would face no criminal charges if she complied with the judgment and paid all the money by an undisclosed deadline. Reuters could not immediately reach Fan or a representative to seek comment. Xinhua said police had put a “restriction” on Fan’s agent for attempting to conceal and destroy evidence during the investigations in June. Fan dropped off the radar that month, amid reports that she was involved in the investigation, a vanishing act that prompted reports she had been detained. On Wednesday, the South China Morning Post said Fan was released two weeks ago from “residential surveillance” at a “holiday resort” in Jiangsu used to investigate officials. She was transferred to Beijing for further investigation, the Post said, citing unnamed sources.     Since June, China has been investigating tax evasion in its film and television industry, following reports that some of its most famous actors have been accused of signing so-called “yin-yang” contracts, one of which sets out the real terms, while a second, with a lower figure, is meant for tax officials. The State Administration of Taxation (SAT) said companies and individuals in the industry who voluntarily “rectify their behavior” and pay back taxes evaded prior to December 31 will be exempt from administrative punishment and fines, Xinhua said.

16,"With Hemlibra, Roche seeks to break into tight hemophilia circle","Swiss drugmaker Roche (ROG.S) is breaking into hemophilia A treatment, a $10 billion global market dominated by rivals who have cultivated close ties to sufferers of the genetic bleeding disorder. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss drugmaker Roche is seen at its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoRoche’s Hemlibra, on sale since late 2017 for patients with resistance to existing treatments, is widely expected to win the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s blessing for use in nearly all patients this week. The FDA declined to comment. First-half sales were just 57 million Swiss francs ($58 million). To hit $5 billion global annual sales that some analysts forecast, Hemlibra must wrest business away from hemophilia giants like Shire (SHP.L), Bayer (BAYGn.DE), Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) and Octapharma, whose “clotting factors” are now standard for people who lack proteins that stop bleeding. These companies have long sponsored patient groups, summer camps, even kayak trips on the Pacific Ocean, as part of efforts to build loyalty they hope will slow an exodus from their products once new drugs like Roche’s arrive. Roche is convinced word of mouth in the hemophilia community, backed up by its studies showing that Hemlibra shots may be more effective and must be administered less frequently than infusions of clotting factors, will overcome any current allegiances. “I’m not familiar with what the other companies are telling the patients,” said Dr. Gallia Levy, who heads Roche’s Hemlibra program. “What I do know is that I’ve seen a lot of patients telling other patients what is happening in their lives. Those sorts of stories mean the most to the patients.” As part of Roche’s initial marketing campaign for Hemlibra, it has produced videos of hemophilia patients participating in daily activities, including riding bikes, in spite of their serious illness. One video shows the consequences of failing to get appropriate treatment, featuring a Serbian man who suffered joint bleeds as a child and now must use crutches. Hemophilia A has become one of medicine’s most lucrative diseases, despite just 20,000 patients in the United States and several hundred thousand worldwide. It almost always affects men, passed down by a mutation on the X chromosome from their mother.  In 2016, the U.S. government alone spent some $2 billion on hemophilia A therapies, data from its Medicaid and Medicare insurance programs show.  Shire’s Adynovate clotting factor runs at $537,000 annually, although costs for severe patients can hit several million dollars.  Roche has priced Hemlibra at $482,000, hefty but a level the independent U.S. pricing group ICER has said could cut overall hemophilia treatment costs significantly. Traditionally a cancer drugs maker, Roche is turning to rare diseases like hemophilia to replace revenue from its older medicines whose expiring patents have exposed the company to unprecedented generic competition. Hemophilia represents the largest market for rare diseases and is expected to grow above 7 percent per year through 2022, Evaluate Pharma has forecast. ‘RELUCTANT TO SWITCH’ In August, Roche defeated a challenge from Shire aimed at delaying Hemlibra’s broad introduction.  Shire fears losing 30 percent of its $2.4 billion annual clotting factors sales to Hemlibra in the short term, court documents show. However, it also indicated it expected patient allegiances to at least mitigate losses. “Patients have loyalty to the brand and to manufacturers, and physicians are reluctant to switch due to risks,” according to Shire testimony cited in the U.S. federal court judge’s ruling. Clotting-factor makers have fostered this loyalty, in part, by sponsoring summer camps for patients and their families. Camp Red Sunrise in Idaho’s Rocky Mountains, sponsored by Shire and Bayer, among others, is free. Another Shire-sponsored retreat, Missouri’s Camp Notaclotamongus, costs $25. In September, Switzerland-based Octapharma sponsored a free sea kayaking expedition for 10 hemophilia patients on Washington State’s Puget Sound, offering a chance to see pods of orca killer whales. Shire, Bayer and Octapharma did not respond to requests for comment on their efforts to boost ties to patients. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, runs PharmedOut, a project that scrutinizes the influence the drug industry has on the practice of medicine.  A 2016 paper she co-authored described hemophilia’s corporate-patient links and how companies use gifts, financial opportunities and one-on-one marketing to advance their commercial interests.  Hemophilia is unique, Fugh-Berman said, since patients play a bigger role in their treatment decisions than elsewhere in medicine where doctors more often call the shots. “Industry’s relationship with individual patients or health care providers is always about selling specific targeted products,” Fugh-Berman told Reuters, adding tight corporate links to patients could hamper discussion including over drug prices, even among patient groups with the best of intentions. “Taking money from industry prevents them from asking hard questions,” she said.  The National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), like nearly all hemophilia patient groups, gets money from companies including Roche to pay for education, research and programs. But a spokesman said the group had strict rules that forbid advocating for a given product. “We are focused on ensuring patients receive access to the treatment that their physician determines to be the most appropriate,” he said by email.  Michelle Rice, the NHF’s head of external affairs and the mother of a hemophilia patient, said convincing everyone in the hemophilia community to quickly switch therapies will be difficult, despite benefits promised by new drugs. That is in part because of the disease’s tragic history. Many hemophilia patients died after acquiring HIV and hepatitis through tainted blood products in the 1980s. “We lost about 10,000 people in our community,” Rice said. “They’re not inclined to just jump to the next bright shiny thing, unless they see a real potential advantage.” When her son was born 28 years ago, Rice said, there were just a handful of therapies available.  Now, there are some two dozen approved products, with more in the pipeline as hemophilia’s potentially rich returns lure companies to pursue new approaches. France’s Sanofi (SASY.PA), which this year bought Biogen’s (BIIB.O) hemophilia business, is working with U.S.-based Alnylam (ALNY.O). Novo Nordisk has an alternative to clotting factors in the works, too.  And experimental one-time gene therapies now being tested by BioMarin (BMRN.O), Spark Therapeutics (ONCE.O) and Sangamo (SGMO.O) would be very expensive, but could end indefinite infusions or injections. This could threaten reliable cash flows for clotting factor makers as well as pose a challenge to Hemlibra. Despite existing relationships between patients and companies, Spark’s Chief Operating Officer John Furey said scientific and financial arguments should win the day. If gene therapy helps patients and reduces overall costs for insurers, Furey said, “we’ll be able to persuade the community this is a very good option for them.” ",Top-Nachrichten,2018-10-03 00:00:00,Reuters
17,Four Californian men charged with inciting violence at 2017 Charlottesville rally,"Four Californian men described by prosecutors as members of a militant white supremacist group were arrested on Tuesday on charges of instigating violence during a white nationalist rally that turned deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. The criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Charlottesville charged each of the four - Benjamin Drake Daley, 25, Michael Paul Miselis, 29, Thomas Walter Gillen, 34, and Cole Evan White, 24 - with violating the federal riots statute and conspiracy to riot. Each defendant faces 10 years in prison if convicted of both counts, authorities said. No pleas were entered. Authorities said all four men flew from the west coast in August 2017 to participate in the “Unite the Right” rally  protesting against the removal of a statue honoring Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate Army in the U.S. Civil War. They are accused of physically assaulting counter-protesters they encountered during the Aug. 12 rally at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, and during a torch-lit march the night before through the University of Virginia campus, where hundreds of Unite the Right demonstrators chanted “white lives matter” and “Jews will not replace us.” The Aug. 12 event ended with a man plowing his car into a crowd, killing one counter-demonstrator, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, and injuring dozens of others. The driver, James Alex Fields Jr., was charged with the killing in June. He has pleaded not guilty. U.S. President Donald Trump drew condemnation from Democratic and Republican political leaders for saying that “many sides” were to blame for the violence. All four of the men newly accused of inciting violence were identified in an FBI affidavit as members and associates of the California-based Rise Above Movement, described as a “militant white supremacist organization.” VIDEO EVIDENCE Prosecutors said their participation in beatings of counter-protesters was corroborated by photographs and video footage from the events, some excerpted in a collection of still images printed in the affidavit. The defendants were also accused of having “engaged in acts of violence” at previous political rallies in Huntington Beach and Berkeley, California. Daley, Miselis and Gillen, all from Southern California, were presented with the charges during separate court appearances on Tuesday before a federal magistrate in Los Angeles. Each was ordered to remain held by the U.S. Marshals Service pending further proceedings. White, a San Francisco-area resident, was scheduled for his initial court hearing in Oakland on Wednesday. All four will end up either transported in federal custody back to Virginia or, if freed on bond, ordered to appear for future court dates there. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jean Rosenbluth denied bond for Miselis, who according to prosecutors had traveled with Daley to Germany, Italy and Ukraine to meet white nationalists abroad. Federal prosecutor David Ryan said thousands of rounds of ammunition, smoke bombs and flares were found at the home of Miselis at the time of his arrest. The judge cited a photograph showing him kicking someone who had fallen to the ground. Miselis’ lawyer, Angel Navarro, described his client in court as having been a well-educated, law-biding citizen who earned a graduate degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. Navarro later told reporters the defendants were all entitled to a presumption of innocence. Attorneys for the others either declined to discuss the case with reporters or were unavailable following the proceedings. Thomas Cullen, U.S. Attorney for the western district of Virginia, said he expected the four could stand trial by year’s end. “This case should serve as another example of the Department of Justice’s commitment to protecting the life, liberty, and civil rights of all our citizens,” Cullen told a news conference. He said prosecutors chose to pursue a case against the four men as a violation of U.S. riot statutes rather than as hate crimes but he did not rule out the possibility of bringing further charges. At least two defense lawyers said they expected a federal indictment to be returned in the case soon.

18,"Amid Kavanaugh fight, Trump says it is a 'scary time' for young men","President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that allegations of sexual misconduct against his U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, showed that “it’s a very scary time for young men in America” who now may be presumed guilty even when innocent. Five days after an extraordinary Senate hearing watched by millions of people in which university professor Christine Blasey Ford detailed her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh, Trump raised the issue of false accusations against men. “My whole life, I’ve heard you’re innocent until proven guilty. But now, you’re guilty until proven innocent. That is a very, very difficult standard,” Trump said outside the White House. “Well, I say that it’s a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of.” The fight over Kavanaugh’s nomination to a lifetime job on the top U.S. court comes against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement fighting sexual harassment and assault that has toppled a succession of powerful men. Under pressure from Democrats and some moderate fellow Republicans, Trump on Friday ordered an FBI investigation lasting up to a week into the allegations against his nominee. He told reporters on Tuesday he thought Kavanaugh would win Senate confirmation once the FBI finishes its investigation. Kavanaugh’s confirmation would consolidate conservative control of the Supreme Court, with disputes involving abortion rights, immigration, gay rights, voting rights and transgender troops possibly heading to the court soon.  The fight over Kavanaugh’s nomination has been unusually emotional and has unfolded just weeks ahead of Nov. 6 elections in which Democrats are trying to seize control of Congress from Republicans. Some Republicans fear pushing ahead with Kavanaugh’s confirmation could alienate women voters, while Democrats are seeking to capitalize on the controversy. Trump, who was himself accused during the 2016 presidential race of sexual misconduct with numerous women, tried to link the allegations against Kavanaugh to what he said was a broader problem. “What’s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. It really does. You could be somebody that was perfect your entire life, and somebody could accuse you of something. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a woman,” Trump said. Ford testified that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party in 1982 when they were high school students in Maryland. At a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night, Trump mocked Ford for not having answers to some questions during her testimony. “What neighborhood was it in? I don’t know. Where’s the house? I don’t know. Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don’t know. But I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember,” Trump said in imitation of Ford’s testimony. “And a man’s life is in tatters,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump rallies supporters during a Make America Great Again rally in Southaven, Mississippi, U.S. October 2, 2018.  REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstANGRY DENIALS In angry and defiant testimony before the Senate, Kavanaugh denied Ford’s accusation, as well as allegations by two other women of sexual misconduct in the 1980s. Senator Jeff Flake, a moderate Republican who could be pivotal in the confirmation vote, raised concerns about the judge’s “partisan” tone at the Judiciary Committee hearing.  “I tell myself, ‘You give a little leeway because of what he’s been through.’ But on the other hand, we can’t have this on the court. We simply can’t,” Flake, who is retiring as a senator in January, said at an event in Washington. Flake voted to approve Kavanaugh in the committee’s vote on Friday that sent the nomination to the full Senate, but he also insisted the FBI investigate the sexual misconduct allegations.  Flake has said Kavanaugh’s nomination would end if the FBI investigation found he had lied in his Senate testimony. Republicans control the Senate by a 51-49 margin. That means if all the Democrats vote against Kavanaugh, Trump could not afford to have more than one Republican oppose his nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said each senator would get a copy of the FBI’s report on its investigation. “But here’s what we know ... one thing for sure. The Senate will vote on Judge Kavanaugh here, on this floor, this week,” McConnell told the chamber. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, said a Friday vote would not give senators enough time to evaluate the FBI probe.    Flake said the FBI had completed interviews with four people.  A lawyer for Kavanaugh’s friend Mark Judge said the FBI had finished its interview with him. Ford identified Judge as a witness to the alleged assault. Judge has previously denied any memory of such an incident. Ford’s lawyers said on Tuesday she had offered her full cooperation with the FBI in its investigation but had received no reply. “It is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Ford’s allegations without interviewing her, Judge Kavanaugh, or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to you,” the lawyers said in their letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray.  Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, separately demanded in a letter to Ford’s lawyers that they provide a range of materials to determine whether her allegations are credible. They include notes from therapy sessions and video or audio recordings of a polygraph test she took.   A person familiar with the matter said the FBI questioned Deborah Ramirez, who has said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when both were Yale University students.  She was questioned for more than two hours on Sunday and provided the FBI with a list of over 20 possible witnesses, the person said.

19,Tesla must defend lawsuit alleging abuse of foreign workers,"A federal judge has ruled that Tesla must defend itself at a trial over allegations it knew foreign workers at its California assembly plant were threatened with deportation if they reported an injury and worked long shifts that violated forced labor laws. FILE PHOTO: A Tesla showroom is seen in Santa Monica, California, U.S., January 4, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoU.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, in San Jose, California, dismissed most of the seven claims against Tesla on Monday, but allowed two claims to survive, paving the way for the plaintiffs to seek documents and witnesses to build their case. The decision comes as Tesla is under pressure to turn a profit and days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk stepped down as chairman to settle allegations by regulators that he misled investors. Tesla has been plagued with safety complaints brought by workers, allegations that Tesla denies. Workers say that long hours and pressure to deliver vehicles quickly takes a toll, and some have pushed for a union. Tesla said it investigated the allegations and broke ties with a subcontractor, ISM Vuzem, that it said did not live up to its expectations. “We’ve also since improved our supplier contracts and policies to better stop bad behavior,” it said in a statement. According to the lawsuit, Gregor Lesnik of Slovenia came to the United States on a B-1 visa and worked 250 hours per month for less than $950, well below minimum wage. It also alleges that foreign workers were threatened with deportation or reduced pay if they reported injuries or became ill.  The 2016 lawsuit by Lesnik and Stjepan Papes of Croatia seeks class action status on behalf of foreigners with B-1 visas working at construction sites at U.S. auto plants. Tesla was one of several automakers named as defendants, but the only one that was not dismissed from the case because plaintiffs only alleged to have suffered threats of deportation at Tesla’s plant in Fremont, California.  Koh denied a motion to dismiss for two Tesla subcontractors, Eisenmann Corp and ISM Vuzem because they operated at the same plant. Eisenmann and Vuzem did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Koh said her ruling was based on a “generous reading of the at times incomprehensible” lawsuit, but also said the allegations against Tesla and Eisenmann were “uncharacteristically specific.” Koh rejected arguments that Tesla and Eisenmann were not liable because the alleged abuses were committed by Vuzem. Koh said a party that benefits financially from another’s abuses also bears liability. The claims she dismissed alleged violations of the False Claims Act, Fair Labor Standards Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.

He would not elaborate on whether the vote would be procedural or a vote to confirm Kavanaugh but said he would fight any Democratic attempts to delay it. The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said Democrats would ask only for adequate time to review results of the FBI report before they vote. He dismissed accusations that Democrats were trying to delay the vote, noting that it was moderate Republicans in the Senate who slowed the Kavanaugh confirmation process in the past week. “The minority has no power to delay, none,” he said.

24,"Vale, BHP reach final deal with prosecutors over Brazil disaster","Brazilian prosecutors in Minas Gerais state said on Tuesday they  reached a final compensation deal with mining companies Samarco, Vale (VALE3.SA) and BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) regarding a 2015 dam burst, Brazil’s largest ever environmental disaster. According to a statement from prosecutors released late on Tuesday, the deal allows for compensation payments to start to relatives of the 19 people killed in the disaster, as well as to people who lost their houses and other properties. No financial details of the deal were disclosed in the short statement on Tuesday, but the chief prosecutor in the city of Mariana will hold a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the agreement. Brazil’s worst environmental catastrophe happened when a dam designed to hold back mine waste from the Samarco iron pellets operation in Mariana burst, leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo states. Another deal had been reached by the mining companies and prosecutors in regions hit by the disaster away from Mariana, where victims found that offer insufficient. With this last settlement, companies might be able to prepare to resume operations in the region more than two years after the accident. Vale has said it expects the Samarco unit to resume operations in 2018 or early next year, but has pushed back forecasts several times. The mine still needs permits to reopen, and the lack of a clear timeline makes it harder for the controlling companies to renegotiate the debt Samarco will carry from the disaster.

25,Trump: I told Saudi king he wouldn't last without U.S. support,"President Donald Trump made an undiplomatic remark about close ally Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, saying he warned Saudi Arabia’s King Salman he would not last in power “for two weeks” without the backing of the U.S. military. FILE PHOTO: Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud welcomes U.S. President Donald Trump during a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 20, 2017.

But I said ‘King - we’re protecting you - you might not be there for two weeks without us - you have to pay for your military,’” Trump said to cheers at a rally in Southaven, Mississippi. Trump did not say when he made those remarks to the Saudi monarch. Despite the harsh words, the Trump administration has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, which it views as a bulwark against Iran’s ambitions in the region. Trump made Saudi Arabia his first stop on his maiden international trip as president last year.   Trump called King Salman on Saturday and they discussed efforts being made to maintain supplies to ensure oil market stability and global economic growth, according to Saudi state news agency SPA. Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter and the de facto leader of OPEC, which has been criticized by Trump for high oil prices. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, Trump said OPEC members were “as usual ripping off the rest of the world.” “We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices,” Trump said. He has also pressed other U.S. allies, such as Japan, South Korea and Germany, to take more of the financial burden of their defense.

26,Bloomberg donating $20 million to Democratic Senate candidates,"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is donating $20 million to help Democratic candidates running for the U.S. Senate, a spokesman said on Tuesday. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg speaks at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton  The billionaire’s contribution comes as Republicans, who currently hold a 51-49 majority in the upper chamber, grow more concerned that Democrats pose a threat of taking control of the Senate in the Nov. 6 congressional elections. The $20 million donation will go to the Senate Majority PAC, Bloomberg spokesman Marc La Vorgna said in an email. The Washington Post first reported the news. It is in addition to $80 million Bloomberg pledged to Democratic House candidates earlier this year. Bloomberg, a Democrat who joined the Republican Party ahead of his first run for New York mayor in 2001 and later declared himself an independent, is seen as a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. He has pumped more cash into this year’s election than in prior races, funneling his donations to Democrats and liberal causes, like pro-gun restriction groups.  Democrats are also aiming to pick up 23 seats in the House of Representatives to win a majority in that chamber, which they say would allow them to more effectively counter Trump’s policies. Analysts see them having a greater chance of winning a majority in the House than the Senate, where they must defend seats in conservative states that Trump won in 2016. But to both parties’ surprise, there are tight races in places where Republicans had initially hoped to have easy campaigns. In Texas, Republican incumbent Ted Cruz is in a dead heat with Democrat Beto O’Rourke. In Tennessee, Republican Marsha Blackburn, a member of the U.S. House, has trailed in most polls behind Democrat Phil Bredesen, a popular former governor.    Bloomberg has spent a significant portion of his fortune  promoting gun control. He founded the group Everytown for Gun Safety in 2014 to change federal laws in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut. Bloomberg is the founder and chief executive of global media company Bloomberg LP. The Senate Majority PAC is controlled by allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Super PACs are allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections but are barred from directly coordinating their efforts with candidates. ",Politik,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
27,America to buzz as phones get 'presidential alert' test Wednesday,"The Trump administration will send messages to more than 200 million U.S. cellphones on Wednesday testing a previously unused presidential alert system that aims to warn the public in the event of a national emergency. U.S. President Donald Trump rallies supporters during a Make America Great Again rally in Southaven, Mississippi, U.S. October 2, 2018.  REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstThe test message was originally scheduled for September but was pushed back to Wednesday at 2:18 p.m. EDT. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which will send the alert, said the messages would bear the headline “Presidential Alert,” and that phones will make a loud tone and have a special vibration.  The test has been scheduled to ensure that the alert system would work in the event of a national emergency. The message will read: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” A separate alert on TV and radios will be issued at 2:20 p.m.. The tests have drawn a lot of attention on social media in part because of President Donald Trump’s propensity for sending tweets to his 55 million followers.  On a conference call, government officials told reporters  that Trump would not personally trigger the alert — from his phone or any other device — and emphasized that no president could “wake up one morning and attempt to send a personal message.” The test alert will be sent by a device similar to a laptop from a FEMA laboratory. An actual alert would be used for an impending missile attack or other national emergency.    Then-President Barack Obama signed a law in 2016 requiring FEMA to create a system allowing the president to send cellphone alerts regarding public safety emergencies. Federal Communications Commissioner Mike O’Rielly told reporters on Tuesday that an April 5 regional test of the emergency alert system in the Washington area showed some potential issues.  He said some people did not receive alerts on some devices during that test. “We’re trying to analyze that,” O’Rielly said. The country’s wireless emergency alert system has issued over 36,000 alerts for situations such as missing children, extreme weather and natural disasters since 2012, but never a presidential directive. Cellphone users can opt out of natural disaster or missing children alerts, but not presidential alerts. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said nearly all of its mobile phone handsets are capable of getting alerts. Government officials estimated that the alert would reach upwards of 225 million U.S. cellphones, or around 75 percent of all phones. They said a person on a call lasting 30 minutes may not get the alert as with phones with an active data connection. ",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
28,"Trade pact clause seen deterring China trade deal with Canada, Mexico","China’s hopes of negotiating a free trade pact with Canada or Mexico were dealt a sharp setback by a provision deep in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that aims to forbid such deals with “non-market” countries, trade experts said on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO: Shipping containers are seen at a port in Shanghai, China July 10, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoThe provision specifies that if one of the current North American Free Trade Agreement partners enters a free trade deal with a “non-market” country such as China, the others can quit in six months and form their own bilateral trade pact. The clause, which has stirred controversy in Canada, fits in with U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to isolate China economically and prevent Chinese companies from using Canada or Mexico as a “back door” to ship products tariff-free to the United States. The United States and China are locked in a spiraling trade war that has seen them level increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other’s imports. Under the clause, the countries in the updated NAFTA, renamed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), must notify the others three months before entering into such negotiations. Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said the provision gave the Trump administration an effective veto over any China trade deal by Canada or Mexico. If repeated in other U.S. negotiations with the European Union and Japan, it could help isolate Beijing in the global trading system. “For both Canada and Mexico, we have a reason to think an FTA with China is a possibility. It’s not imminent, but this is a very elegant way of dealing with that,” Scissors said.    “There’s no China deal that’s worth losing a ratified USMCA,” Scissors added. After months of bashing its Western allies on trade, the Trump administration is now trying to recruit them to join the United States in pressuring China to shift its trade, subsidy and intellectual property practices to a more-market driven focus.  Beijing has demanded that the World Trade Organization recognize it as a “market economy” since its WTO accession agreement expired in December 2016, a move that would severely limit Western trade defenses against cheap Chinese goods.   But the United States and European Union are challenging the declaration, arguing that Chinese state subsidies fuelling excess industrial capacity, the exclusion of foreign competitors and other practices are signs it is still a non-market economy.       CANADIAN SOVEREIGNTY QUESTIONED Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, seeking to diversify Canada’s export base, held exploratory talks with China on trade in 2016, but a launch of formal negotiations has failed to materialize. Tracey Ramsey, a legislator for Canada’s left-leaning New Democrats, said in the House of Commons on Tuesday that the clause was “astonishing” and a “severe restriction on Canadian independence.”   “Part of Canada’s concessions in this deal was to include language that holds Canada hostage to the Americans if we decide to trade with another country,” Ramsey said. “Why did the Liberal (Party) give the go-ahead for the U.S. to pull us into their trade wars?” Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau downplayed the provision, arguing it was not significantly different from NAFTA’s clause that allows any member to leave the pact in six months’ time for any reason.     “It is largely the same. It recognize though that the non-market economy is of significant importance as we move forward. But I don’t think it’s going to make a material difference in our activities,” Morneau told a business audience. Mexico’s business community sided with the Trump administration in endorsing the pact. “We are associating ourselves with countries that promote market freedom and that promote free trade in the world, free trade under equal circumstances,” said Juan Pablo Castañon, head of the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial (CCE), which represented Mexico’s private sector during the NAFTA trade talks.

29,North Carolina town may never fully recover from double whammy of storms,"The childhood home Katrina Bullock returned to in the rural North Carolina community of Fair Bluff about 16 years ago to care for her sick mother was devastated by flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. A new roof went up after that. Walls saturated with muddy floodwaters were being replaced and things were looking up until a new storm, Hurricane Florence struck about 23 months later in September. “We were starting to get it all back together and there comes Florence, and it takes it all again,” said Bullock. She and other residents of Fair Bluff, and of many other communities in the southern and southeast parts of North Carolina hit by the double whammy of Matthew and Florence, are sorting through the latest wreckage, wondering if it is worth remaining. Settlers first arrived in the area around Fair Bluff in the mid-1700s and one of the oldest buildings in Columbus County, where the town is located, is a trading post built on the banks of the Lumber River in the town, according to the local chamber of commerce. In the 19th century, railroads helped keep the economy flowing. Experts say such hamlets and towns face permanent changes, with fewer residents, fewer businesses and fewer prospects of returning to the way things were just a generation ago. Older residents whose roots run deep and those too poor to leave will soon likely make up the bulk of the population. Those who can will leave, but others will do their best to rebuild. “There will be a real desire to make Fair Bluff the best it can be, but it may look and be a different thing from what it has historically been,” said Patrick Woodie, president of the NC Rural Center, an economic development organization. Even before Florence hit, many small towns in North Carolina were struggling due to a decline in agriculture and manufacturing. Poverty rates in the state are higher now than in the aftermath of the recession about a decade ago due to the loss of small industries such as textile and a downturn in the farming sector, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a progressive research and advocacy organization. Matthew led to catastrophic flooding throughout low-lying eastern North Carolina and caused billions of dollars in damage. In took 28 lives in the United States while Florence killed more than 50 and drove many rural communities into deeper despair. Katrina Bullock, who is still in the process of rebuilding after floods from Hurricane Matthew in 2016,  cleans the inside of her home after flooding due to Hurricane Florence receded in Fair Bluff, North Carolina, U.S. September 29, 2018. REUTERS/Randall HillFair Bluff is a mostly agricultural community with a Main Street book-ended by two churches and nestled next to the Lumber River, a usually peaceful waterway that flooded during both Matthew and Florence. The town’s small commercial area was struggling to get back into business after Matthew and inundated again with Florence. Many wonder if it will ever open again. Almost all the stores on Main Street closed after Matthew and when Florence rolled in, the floodwaters brought fresh destruction to places like a furniture shop that had yet to remove all of its water-logged inventory from two years ago. After the flooding from Florence receded, a dark muck covered floors in affected areas and a smell wafted through the air combining odors of moldy rot and a sewage plant that overflowed in the most recent storm. Fair Bluff Mayor Billy Hammond believes the town had about 1,000 residents before Matthew and was left with about half that afterward, with many evacuees just never returning.  The permanent population now is probably about 350 to 400, most of them people whose homes were not flooded, he said. “It has been a ghost town for about two years,” he said in an interview. “We’re just going have to take it one day at a time and move forward and hope that people come back,” he said. Fair Bluff is about 125 miles (200 km) south of Raleigh. About 21 percent of the population lives below the poverty line and median household income is $28,611, according to U.S. Census data. In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, home to the vibrant city of Charlotte, median household income is more than double that in Fair Bluff and the poverty rate is about half. In low-lying areas near the river where some of the poorest people in Fair Bluff live, many have returned to storm-damaged homes because they do not have the money to move or rebuild.A disproportionate number of low-income people live in flood plains in river communities, according to Gavin Smith, a professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Randy Britt, 71, who has lived in Fair Bluff all his life owns buildings on the Main Street commercial area and is working to re-open a flood-hit store. Slideshow (17 Images)“There is always hope. If there wasn’t hope, I wouldn’t be in Fair Bluff right now,” he said in an interview. ",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
30,"France points finger at Iran over bomb plot, seizes assets","France said on Tuesday there was no doubt Iran’s intelligence ministry was behind a June plot to attack an exiled opposition group’s rally outside Paris and it seized assets belonging to Tehran’s intelligence services and two Iranian nationals. The hardening of relations between Paris and Tehran could have far-reaching consequences for Iran as President Hassan Rouhani’s government looks to European capitals to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal after the United States pulled out and reimposed tough sanctions on Iran. “Behind all this was a long, meticulous and detailed investigation by our (intelligence) services that enabled us to reach the conclusion, without any doubt, that responsibility fell on the Iranian intelligence ministry,” a French diplomatic source said. The source, speaking after the government announced asset freezes, added that the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, had ordered the attack and Assadollah Asadi, a Vienna-based diplomat held by German authorities, had put it into action. The ministry is under control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  “We deny once again the allegations against Iran and demand the immediate release of the Iranian diplomat,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.  The incident was a plot “designed by those who want to damage Iran’s long-established relations with France and Europe,” he said. The plot targeted a meeting of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) outside the French capital. U.S. President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and several former European and Arab ministers attended the rally. It unraveled after Asadi, an accredited diplomat in Austria, was arrested in Germany, two other individuals were detained in Belgium in possession of explosives, and one other individual in France. On Monday, a court in southern Germany ruled the diplomat could be extradited to Belgium. “We cannot accept any terrorist threat on our national territory and this plot needed a firm response,” the diplomatic source said. FILE PHOTO: Supporters of Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), attend a rally in Villepinte, near Paris, France, June 30, 2018.   REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoTARGETED ASSET FREEZES In a news briefing in Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert noted the French action and said it was evidence that “there’s probably no one who has felt terrorism stemming from Iran perhaps more than - well, the Syrians - that has felt it more than some Europeans.”  The asset freezes targeted Asadi and Moghadam. A unit within the Iranian intelligence services was also targeted. The French government gave no details of the assets involved, describing its measures as “targeted and proportionate.” The diplomatic source said the freezes covered assets and financing means in France, although neither individual at this stage had any assets in the country. “We hope this matter is now over. We have taken measures and said what we needed to say,” the source said, suggesting Paris was seeking to turn a page on the issue.  France had warned Tehran to expect a robust response to the thwarted bombing and diplomatic relations were becoming increasingly strained.  French President Emmanuel Macron and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian spoke to their Iranian counterparts about the issue at the U.N. General Assembly after demanding explanations over Iran’s role. An internal French foreign ministry memo in August told diplomats not to travel to Iran, Reuters revealed, citing the Villepinte bomb plot and a toughening of Iran’s position toward the West. Paris has also suspended nominating a new ambassador to Iran and has not responded to Tehran nominations for diplomatic positions in France. While not directly linked to the plot, the diplomatic source said a French police raid on a Shi’ite Muslim faith center earlier on Tuesday was aimed at also sending a signal at Iran.  The deterioration of relations with France could have wider implications for Iran.  France has been one of the strongest advocates of salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Tehran agree to curbs on its nuclear program in return for a lifting of economic  sanctions.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File PhotoThe Pentagon said in a statement that it had put its mail facility under quarantine and that the FBI was analyzing the envelopes. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the envelopes initially tested positive for ricin after being detected by Pentagon police on Monday at a mail sorting facility  on the Pentagon compound but not in the main building. Separately, the U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating a “suspicious envelope” addressed to President Donald Trump that was received on Monday, though it never entered the White House. The agency did not provide further details. It was not immediately known if the two incidents were related. Ricin is found naturally in castor beans but it takes a deliberate act to convert it into a biological weapon. Ricin can cause death within 36 to 72 hours from exposure to an amount as small as a pinhead. No known antidote exists. U.S. government buildings have sporadically received packages with suspected ricin, including in 2013 when ricin-laced letters were addressed to a U.S. senator, the White House and a Mississippi justice official. Shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., letters containing another deadly substance,  anthrax spores, were mailed to the Washington offices of two senators and to media outlets in New York and Florida.

32,Physics Nobel for laser pioneers includes first woman in 55 years,"A trio of American, French and Canadian scientists won the 2018 Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday for breakthroughs in laser technology that have turned light beams into precision tools for everything from eye surgery to micro-machining. They include the first female physics prize winner in 55 years. Canada’s Donna Strickland, of the University of Waterloo, becomes only the third woman to win a Nobel for physics, after Marie Curie in 1903 and Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963. Arthur Ashkin of Bell Laboratories in the United States won half of the 2018 prize for inventing “optical tweezers”, while Strickland shared the remainder with Frenchman Gerard Mourou, who also has U.S. citizenship, for work on high-intensity lasers. “Obviously we need to celebrate women physicists,” Strickland said shortly after learning of the prize.  The Nobel prizes have long been dominated by male scientists, and none more so than physics. Strickland is the first female Nobel laureate in any field in three years. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said last year it would seek to more actively encourage nominations of women researchers to begin addressing the imbalance. Strickland later spoke of how her predecessor, Goeppert Mayer, had been “allowed to follow her husband from job to job while he ... went up the ranks as a professor”, while she was only allowed to teach or do unpaid research.  “Women have come a long way,” she told a news conference in Canada. Her win comes a day after Europe’s physics research center CERN suspended an Italian scientist, Alessandro Strumia, for telling a seminar at the organization’s Swiss headquarters last week that physics was “invented and built by men” and that women were now being favored in hiring for research positions. Jessica Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who was at the CERN event and unhappy about Strumia’s comments, said having a female Nobel winner was also important given the current fight over U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing sexual misconduct allegations.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Charles Platiau/Peter Power“This news could not come at a better time,” Wade told Reuters. “After a week where a woman has been forced to describe her sexual assault to a live television audience of billions, and an academic at a prestigious university has said that women are unfairly promoted into senior positions in physics, even I – the eternal optimist – was starting to lose hope.” PRECISION INSTRUMENTS The inventions by the three scientists awarded this year’s Nobel Prize for Physics date back to the mid-1980s and over the years they have revolutionized laser physics. “Advanced precision instruments are opening up unexplored areas of research and a multitude of industrial and medical applications,” the academy said on awarding the nine million Swedish crown ($1 million) prize. Ashkin’s work was based on the realization that the pressure of a beam of light could push microscopic objects and trap them in position. A breakthrough came in 1987, when he used the new optical tweezers to grab living bacteria without harming them. At 96, Ashkin is the oldest ever Nobel prize winner, but he is still busy with fresh research. “I am busy working right now, writing an important paper on solar energy,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I’m surprised,” Ashkin said about winning the prize. “A guy called me up on the phone and woke me up.” Mourou and Strickland’s research centered on developing the most intense laser pulses ever created by humans, paving the way for the precision instruments used today in corrective eye surgery and industrial applications. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace have been awarded since 1901 in accordance with the will of Swedish business tycoon Alfred Nobel, whose discovery of dynamite generated a vast fortune used to fund the prize. Physics is the second of this year’s crop of prizes and comes after the medicine prize was awarded on Monday for  discoveries about how to harness and manipulate the immune system to fight cancer. However, for the first time in decades no Nobel Prize for literature will be given this year after a scandal over sexual misconduct allegations saw a string of members leave the board of the Swedish Academy that awards it.

33,How Trump's son-in-law helped salvage the North American trade zone,"Robert Lighthizer was the public face of arduous, year-long talks to rework NAFTA, but as he savored a successful conclusion in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, the U.S. trade representative singled out another man as the deal’s architect.  “I’ve said before, and I’ll say again, this agreement would not have happened if it wasn’t for Jared,” Lighthizer told reporters.  The 70-year-old veteran negotiator was referring to Jared Kushner, more than 30 years his junior and Donald Trump’s son-in-law, whom the president had asked to help out on trade early in the presidency, especially on Canada and Mexico.  While Kushner’s time in the White House has been turbulent - Chief of Staff John Kelly temporarily stripped him of his security clearance this year and he has been criticized for his dealings with the Middle East - his role in keeping the North American Trade Agreement afloat was fundamental, multiple sources said. A 37-year-old real estate tycoon married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, Kushner has the trust of his father-in-law, and crucially, is close to Lighthizer, a Canadian source with knowledge of the talks said.  His friendship with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, whom he knows through Wall Street connections, helped defuse several blow-ups in that relationship and get a U.S.-Mexican deal over the finish line in August, another source close to the talks said. “The deal fell apart more than once. And in every occasion it was one person that always found a way to put it back together: Jared Kushner,” Videgaray told Reuters. Kushner’s help in the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) could pay dividends down the road.  Kushner, who traveled to China with Trump last year, has a good relationship with the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said a source familiar with the situation. That may be useful when Trump moves to cool his trade war with the Asian nation. The Trump administration slapped tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods last month and is threatening duties on virtually all of the goods China exports to the United States. On Monday, flanked by Lighthizer and Kushner in the Rose Garden, the president said “it’s too early to talk” to China. Michael Pillsbury, a China expert and former national security official who served on the Trump transition team, said the new deal could encourage China to negotiate, but could also raise fears the United States was trying to contain it.  “Kushner’s contacts with the Chinese ambassador and his skill at diplomacy can certainly help reduce Chinese paranoia and hopefully coax them into making their first negotiating offer,” said Pillsbury, currently at the Hudson Institute.   TOXIC MOOD From early on in the negotiations, two of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s most trusted advisers - chief of staff Katie Telford and private secretary Gerald Butts - also forged ties with Kushner, Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said in a telephone interview. Yussuff was part of the NAFTA advisory council for Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s lead negotiator in the talks and the country’s foreign minister.   A second Canadian source said Telford and Butts flew to Washington to meet Kushner in the early days of the presidency. Those connections came to the fore again last week, when the mood became toxic between Lighthizer and Freeland, as the U.S.-imposed Sept. 30 deadline to conclude the talks loomed. A third Canadian source directly familiar with the talks said the Americans “were incensed” when Freeland took part in a Toronto panel entitled “Taking on the Tyrant,” which featured derogatory comments about Trump. Trump summed up the atmosphere in typically blunt fashion, saying on Wednesday, “We don’t like their representative very much,” as the Canadian team dug in on the issue of U.S. access to Canada’s dairy market.  “There was a moment where the traditional channels of negotiations appeared to break down because they just could not get through some of the largest issues, dairy being one of them,” said a person in Washington familiar with the situation. Kushner kept talking to Butts and Telford, and on Thursday a message got through that the United States wanted to know what was non-negotiable for Canada. The answer went back that Chapter 19, a dispute resolution mechanism, was a red line.  By Friday morning it was clear the Trump administration was not going to fight for Chapter 19 anymore - “the Americans blinked,” said a fourth senior Canadian source with direct knowledge of the talks. “I don’t think the administration itself was that hung up on (Chapter) 19, I think Robert Lighthizer was,” Yussuff said.  The breakthrough triggered concessions from Trudeau’s team, most importantly on dairy. The fourth Canadian source described the thinking as “better get dairy out of the way now” rather than negotiating from a weaker position if talks failed and Trump hit them with 25 percent auto tariffs, the stick he had used to hurry along talks with Mexico and Canada since May.   On Friday, Kushner got Lighthizer on a conference call with Telford and Butts. “Together the four of them worked through some of the outstanding issues and that led to a breakthrough in the negotiations, ultimately leading to the success of the deal,” said the person in Washington. With a deal in sight, Mexico and the United States canceled plans to publish on Friday evening the text of their bilateral deal to give Canada the chance to join by the Sunday deadline. The talks intensified, with Telford “talking on the phone the entire time,” in the end with Kushner, said the fourth Canadian source. The offices of Freeland and Trudeau did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. INTENSIFYING EFFORTS It was by no means a foregone conclusion that NAFTA would survive. After demanding early last year that it be reworked in favor of the United States, Trump repeatedly threatened to toss in the trash the $1.2 trillion, quarter-century-old agreement. Tensions between the United States and Canada started at the top, with relations strained between Trump and Trudeau after acrimonious talks in Quebec City in June at a G7 summit. “There was a lot of tension, I will say, between he and I - I think, more specifically,” Trump told a news conference on Monday. “You know when it ended? About 12 o’clock last night.” At every slump in the talks, which began formally in August last year, multiple players helped stabilize the situation. One of the hairiest moments was in April last year, when trade experts say Trump was close to triggering U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, prompting frantic lobbying from business groups.  Trump changed his mind, according to one source close to the talks, only after agriculture minister Sonny Perdue showed the president a map including all the Trump-supporting, farming states that would suffer lost exports if NAFTA collapsed.  The United States Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment about this incident, which has been previously reported by Reuters and other media. Similarly, there was more to bringing the talks to a last-minute finale than just Kushner’s efforts. Outside factors were also pushing all sides toward a deal. In the weeks following the announcement of the Mexico-U.S. deal, U.S. and Mexican officials increasingly understood a new trade accord might not pass Congress without Canada on board, said one U.S.-based source familiar with the process. Anxious to avoid being left with nothing, Videgaray and Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico’s lead in the negotiations, worked behind the scenes to “triangulate” communication between the Canadians and the Americans to try to land the deal, the source said. Videgaray’s relationship with Kushner was a safety valve that lowered tensions between Freeland and Lighthizer, the source said. Another source said Guajardo offered Freeland advice on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last week about negotiating bilaterally with Lighthizer. In the end, the talks went down to the wire, with Kushner abandoning plans to spend the Jewish festival of Sukkot with his family late on Sunday, the person in Washington said, as Canada and the United States thrashed out the last details of a deal. It was finally announced at 11:35 p.m. EDT (0335 GMT), just 25 minutes before the deadline.

35,Number of U.S. diplomats doubled in Syria as Islamic State nears defeat: Mattis,"The number of U.S. diplomats in Syria has doubled as Islamic State fighters near a military defeat, U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis said on Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis attends a news conference with French Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly (not pictured) at the Defence Ministry in Paris, France, October 2, 2018. REUTERS/Philippe WojazerThe U.S.-led coalition, along with local partners, has largely cleared the militant group from Iraq and Syria but remains concerned about its resurgence. “Our diplomats there on the ground have been doubled in number. As we see the military operations becoming less, we will see the diplomatic effort now able to take (root)” Mattis said.  He did not give a specific number.  A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis was referring to State Department employees, including diplomats and personnel involved in humanitarian assistance, and the increase was recent.  The United States does not have an embassy in Syria.  In a sign of the threat still posed by the militant group, security forces in northern Syria’s Raqqa said on Sunday they had uncovered an Islamic State sleeper cell which was plotting large attacks across the devastated city. Raqqa served as the de facto capital of Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate until it was retaken by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance last October. In June, the SDF imposed a three-day curfew in Raqqa and declared a state of emergency, saying Islamic State militants had infiltrated the city and were planning a bombing campaign. “We are still in a tough fight, make no mistake about it,” Mattis said. He said troops would work after the defeat of Islamic State to ensure that the militant group did not return.  Russia has held the balance of power in Syria, both on the battlefield and in the U.N.-led peace talks, for the past two years. It has helped Syrian President Bashar al-Assad recover huge amounts of lost territory without persuading him to agree to any political reforms. But nine rounds of talks, most of them in Geneva, have failed to bring the warring sides together to end a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes. The United States has said it will pursue “a strategy of isolation”, including sanctions, with its allies if Assad holds up a political process aimed at ending Syria’s seven-year-old war.

37,FDA seizes documents from Juul in latest e-cigarette crackdown,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it seized more than a thousand pages of documents from Juul Labs related to the company’s sales and marketing practices after a surprise inspection, the latest clampdown on e-cigarette companies. The FDA said last month it was considering a ban on flavored e-cigarettes from Juul and others as the agency grapples with an “epidemic” of youth e-cigarette use that threatens to create a new generation of nicotine addicts. Retail sales of Juul grew more than seven-fold from 2016 to 2017, according to a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By December, Juul comprised nearly 1 in 3 e-cigarette sales nationally, it said. The CDC study of retail sales did not include online sales or sales at  “vape shops.” Juul has about 72 percent of the U.S. market for e-cigarette sales, according to Wells Fargo.  “Juuling,” along with “vaping,” has become a common term for e-cigarette use by teenagers on social media and at U.S. high schools. E-cigarettes vaporize a liquid that contains nicotine, the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush.  The inspection, completed on Friday, followed a request in April for documents that would help the agency better understand the high rates of use and appeal among youth of Juul products. The FDA also said it conducted inspections of several of Juul’s contract manufacturing units earlier this year. “We’ve now released over 50,000 pages of documents to the FDA since April that support our public statements,” Juul Chief Executive Officer Kevin Burns said in a statement, adding the meeting with the regulator was constructive and transparent. A woman smokes a Juul e-cigarette in New York, U.S., September 27, 2018.  REUTERS/Brendan McDermid“We want to be part of the solution in preventing underage use, and we believe it will take industry and regulators working together to restrict youth access”. The FDA’s regulation of e-cigarettes has come under the spotlight as Juul’s popularity surged. U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Lisa Murkowski in a letter on Tuesday urged the FDA to immediately ban child-friendly e-cigarette flavorings and restrict online sales of nicotine products. “While it remains unclear whether e-cigarettes can actually help adults quit smoking cigarettes, it is abundantly clear that tobacco companies are developing and marketing e-cigarette flavors that appeal to, and addict, children,” the senators wrote.  In July, Durbin, a Democrat, and Murkowski, a Republican, introduced legislation that would place restrictions on e-cigarette flavorings that appeal to children like gummy bear, chocolate cupcake and tutti fruitti.  Along with the Juul phenomenon, a new wave of lower-priced Juul knockoffs are showing up at convenience stores, vape shops and online, despite an FDA rule that banned the sale of new e-cigarettes after August 2016 without regulatory approval.   Startups and major tobacco firms have launched more than a dozen new high-nicotine devices with Juul-like designs since the FDA imposed the deadline, according to a Reuters review of the companies’ online advertisements, social media posts and public statements. Shares of tobacco companies, including Philip Morris (PM.N), Altria (MO.N), British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L), jumped after the FDA announcement. Juul’s flash-drive-like device is recharged via a USB port. The device comes with cartridges, or pods, of nicotine-based liquids in flavors like mango, creme and mint — that critics say appeal to minors.  The newest liquid blends from Juul and its imitators - called “nicotine salts” in the industry - contain a compound called benzoic acid, which lowers the pH level of the liquid. That reduction allows users to take in more nicotine without a bitter taste, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ",Top-Nachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
38,Exclusive: Exxon explores sale of U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets - sources,"Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is exploring the sale of many of its U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets, as higher prices prompt the world’s largest publicly traded oil company to review its portfolio, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Major oil companies have been looking to concentrate development operations in a few key areas. Irving, Texas-based Exxon is focusing on promising acreage in offshore areas such as Guyana and Brazil and onshore in the Permian basin of Texas.    Exxon has asked a small number of parties to gauge their potential interest in the company’s Gulf assets, ahead of deciding how to proceed, according to two of the sources, adding that any sale would likely happen next year. The company is considering selling deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico that currently produce about 50,000 barrels per day of oil, one of the sources added. The company has stakes in Gulf assets that produce the equivalent of more than 200,000 barrels of oil per day and 730 million cubic feet of gas daily, according to company data.  Exxon produces the equivalent of about 2.2 million barrels of oil daily. While Exxon is the most valuable publicly traded oil company, it is only the ninth-largest operator in the Gulf, trailing heavyweights like Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) and BP Plc (BP.L), along with smaller Gulf-focused independent oil companies like Fieldwood and Talos. The Gulf of Mexico, once considered a reliable basin for oil exploration and production, has become overshadowed by shale formations onshore and by new offshore plays like Guyana, where Exxon’s giant Liza field is expected to produce 120,000 barrels per day of crude in its first phase. “Exxon Mobil continually reviews its assets for their contribution toward meeting the company’s operating needs, financial objectives and their potential value to others,” a spokeswoman for Exxon said in a statement. “We remain committed to conducting business in the U.S. Gulf region, as we have for more than 100 years.” The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Exxon’s positions in the Gulf of Mexico include a 50 percent stake in development of the large Julia oil field, and a 47 percent stake in the Hadrian South natural gas field, which it operates. The company also has a 9 percent piece of Heidelberg field and 23 percent of the Lucius oil and gas field, both of which are operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), according to Exxon’s latest annual report. Exxon’s partners in developing many of these sites could have a contractual right of first refusal on any opportunity to acquire Exxon’s interest, one of the sources said. Exxon has sold 29 leases or stakes in leases to other companies since 2014, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.  The company has not acquired any leases from other companies in that period. In the last 10 federal lease sales of oil acreage, Exxon has bid on 28 leases, compared with rivals like BP, which has bid on 52 leases.  Exxon shares were up 0.7 percent to $86.42 each on Tuesday. Shares have risen 6.5 percent this year, trailing broader equity averages. Qatar, which has a number of partnerships with Exxon, including in Brazil, would be well positioned to make an offer for the Gulf of Mexico assets, the sources said. Exxon has an extensive partnership with Qatar, including partnering with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] to develop the world’s largest non-associated natural gas field off that country’s coast. Qatar Petroleum also bought a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon’s affiliates in Argentina in June, giving Qatar access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country. Qatar Petroleum’s chief executive told Reuters in May that the company was expanding its upstream business and assets abroad, particularly in the United States. Qatar Petroleum is the majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips holding smaller stakes. It could not be established whether Qatar will indeed make an offer. Qatar government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This week, Chevron Corp agreed to sell its North Sea holdings off the shore of Britain. ",Top-Nachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
39,'A tale of two hurricanes' for September U.S. new car sales,"Major automakers on Tuesday posted a hefty drop in U.S. new vehicle sales for September, caused in part by a decline in sales in areas hit by Hurricane Florence and a tough comparison to the previous September when consumers rushed to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey. FILE PHOTO:    Cars sit in flooded waters due to Hurricane Florence, now downgraded to a tropical depression, in Lumberton, North Carolina, U.S., September 18, 2018.     Picture taken September 18, 2018.    55th Combat Camera/Spc. Andrea Salgado Rivera/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo         ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTYFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) bucked the trend for the month, reporting a 15 percent jump in U.S. sales, led by increases in sales of its lucrative Jeeps - especially its Cherokee and Compass models - and Ram pickup trucks.  The solid performance put FCA’s total sales ahead of longtime No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co (F.N) for the month of September. Hurricane Florence flooded large parts of North Carolina and South Carolina last month, leaving residents to deal with the deluge instead of shopping for new cars. Sales in September 2017 were boosted by major replacement demand for water-damaged vehicles following Hurricane Harvey, which had flooded parts of southeastern Texas in August that year. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales (SAAR) for September hit 18.1 million units in September 2017 - the highest sales pace since 2005.  Despite the sales decline versus the same month in 2017, according to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the SAAR of U.S. car and light truck sales for September came in at 17.44 million vehicles - the highest sales pace since November 2017. This was above the SAAR of 16.9 million units expected by analysts.  After a strong first half of the year, U.S. new auto sales are expected to dip in the second half of 2018, as rising interest rates in particular translate into higher monthly car payments and push more Americans toward buying used vehicles. U.S. consumers last month continued a longstanding trend of abandoning passenger cars for larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs. “September was a bloodbath for cars,” Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs told reporters on a conference call. “They dropped like a rock.” Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Tuesday reported an 11.2 percent drop in sales, with declines in every major category. Sales of sedans were down nearly 26 percent.  Ford also posted a decline of nearly 9 percent for sales of its best-selling, and highly profitable, F-Series pickup trucks and a 2.7 percent drop in sales of SUVs.

REUTERS/Jason Miczek/File PhotoIn a conference call with analysts and reporters, Ford’s U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve referred to September as a “tale of two hurricanes.” “Hurricane Florence was a big factor this month,” LaNeve said, adding that post-storm recovery efforts were “moving quickly.”  General Motors Co (GM.N) said its third-quarter sales were down 11.1 percent versus the same period in 2017. Earlier this year, the No. 1 U.S. automaker stopped reporting monthly sales, arguing that a 30-day snapshot did not accurately portray market trends. Sales were down at all of GM’s major brands, with particularly sharp decreases for passenger cars. “Our brands are very well-positioned for the fourth quarter when our next wave of new products start shipping in high volume,” Kurt McNeil, GM U.S. vice president for sales, said in a news release. GM has high hopes for all-new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.  Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said its U.S. new-vehicle sales fell 10.4 percent in September. Sedan sales at the Japanese automaker were off nearly 28 percent. That included a 17 percent decline for its flagship Camry midsize sedan, which was completely redesigned with the aim of increasing market share. Toyota’s SUV and pickup truck sales were down 0.3 percent for the month. Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) reported a 12.2 percent drop in sales for September, with a 35.7 percent decline in passenger car sales more than offsetting a 6.6 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.  Sales of Nissan’s best-selling vehicle, the Rogue crossover, fell 10.6 percent in September. “It was a tough comparison for sales year-over-year, but otherwise the month was very solid for us with some bright spots,” said Billy Hayes, the automaker’s vice president for regional operations in North America. “We’re still extremely bullish and we’re feeling very good about the rest of the year.” Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) said sales were off 7 percent in September, as a 19 percent decrease in passenger cars outmatched a 6.3 percent rise in pickup truck and SUV sales.  Monthly sales of the automaker’s completely revamped Accord dropped by 15 percent. Ford shares closed 1.3 percent lower at $9.20 on Tuesday. GM shares were down 2.6 percent at $33.30 and FCA shares dipped 0.6 percent to close at $17.88 in New York trading. ",Top-Nachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters

The MSCI world equity index dipped 0.33 percent, paring Monday’s gains that followed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.57 percent. Two of Wall Street’s three major indexes closed lower on Tuesday, but shares of companies including Boeing and Caterpillar CAT.N pushed up the Dow, which closed at a fresh record high.

In Italy, the economics spokesman for the country’s ruling League party, Claudio Borghi, said in a radio interview that most of the country’s problems could be solved by having its own currency.  His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new 4-1/2-year high, pushing the yield spread between Italian debt and German Bunds to their widest in over five years. Shares in Italian banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low before recovering some of their losses. “We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one side and Italy on the other,” said Valentin Marinov, Credit Agricole’s head of G10 FX Strategy. “There’s a lot of headline risk about.” Borghi and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed down, calling the euro “unrenounceable”, helping to calm markets and erasing losses for Italy’s FTSE MIB. The euro fell to its weakest since Aug. 21 at $1.1505, before retracing to $1.1551, down 0.22 percent on the day.

The United States and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to salvage a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation. The trade pact helped the dollar index rise to 95.744 - its highest since Aug. 21 - and it was last up 0.17 percent. The dollar’s strength weighed on the leading emerging markets stock index, which fell 1.2 percent, setting it on course for its biggest one-day loss for a month.  Gold rose to its highest level in more than a week as investors sought refuge in the safe haven after equity markets weakened. Spot gold added 1.3 percent to $1,202.69 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.32 percent to $1,207.40 an ounce. Oil prices eased slightly on Tuesday, remaining close to four-year highs on worries that global supplies will drop due to Washington’s sanctions on Iran.

41,Tesla worried by China tariffs even as deliveries surge,"Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) announced record quarterly car production on Tuesday but warned of major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs that would force it to accelerate investment in its factory in Shanghai.     In July, China raised tariffs on imports of U.S. autos to 40 percent amid a worsening trade war with the United States. Tesla said the combination of tariffs and transportation costs was hurting Tesla sales in the world’s biggest electric car market, sending shares down 2 percent to $304.37. “Taking ocean transport costs and import tariffs into account, Tesla is now operating at a 55 percent to 60 percent cost disadvantage compared to the exact same car locally produced in China,” the company said.     The California-based electric carmaker, emerging from several months of turmoil stemming from its tweeting Chief Executive Elon Musk, said it produced 80,142 vehicles in the third quarter, a 50 percent jump from its prior quarter as the company strives to master volume production. Tesla has scrambled to get the Model 3 into the hands of customers, many of whom have been waiting since early 2016. Vehicles have piled up in lots around California awaiting transport, and Musk said last month that Tesla had moved from “production hell to delivery logistics hell.”  Tesla delivered 83,500 cars, including 55,840 Model 3 sedans, which topped Wall Street forecasts.   As the quarter drew to a close on Sept. 30, Musk invited Tesla owners to volunteer at delivery centers to help new owners picking up their Model 3s, answering questions and giving vehicle overviews.  Tesla reduced the number of Model 3s in transit to customers to 15 percent of total Model 3s delivered from 60 percent in the second quarter, a figure watched by analysts as an indicator of future revenue and of Tesla’s efficiency.  But the company in its release did not reiterate Musk’s oft-repeated promise that Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in both its third and fourth quarters. Tesla is expected to release quarterly financial results next month. Slideshow (2 Images)Musk wrote in an email to employees on Saturday the company was “very close to achieving profitability” but for that it must stabilize a brutal ramp-up in output whose targets it has consistently struggled to meet.  Tesla has been burning cash and holding out the promise that churning out Model 3s at volume and a profit could ease its crunch. The figures announced on Tuesday did not specify profit margins for the new car, although Tesla sold mostly higher-priced variants.  “Bottom line is cash is tight,” wrote Gene Munster, head of research at brokerage Loup Ventures, who estimated that Tesla needs $1.5 billion to sustain operations. It ended the second quarter with about $2.3 billion. “This is a step in the right direction, but more work remains.”  Tesla also is recovering from a fight with U.S. securities regulators over whether Musk misled investors when he tweeted in August that he was considering taking the company private and had secured funding.  Tesla and Musk reached a settlement on Saturday where the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive. On average, Tesla produced about 4,000 Model 3s per week during the quarter. It first hit a goal of building 5,000 vehicles in a week at the end of June, and had hoped to reach a new target of making 6,000 Model 3s per week by the end of August.  CHINA PLANS Amid the worsening of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, Tesla said it was speeding up construction of its Shanghai Gigafactory but provided no details. Musk in July landed a deal with Chinese authorities to build a new combined auto and battery plant in Shanghai, its first outside the United States and a key to doubling its global capacity. Local debt, he said, would finance the factory, which Tesla estimated would cost about $2 billion. Tigress Research analyst Ivan Feinseth said Musk “continues to downplay” the need for cash to fund projects beyond the China plant. “I believe he will need to raise additional money even if he is profitable for this quarter as he as projected,” said Feinseth, citing the cost of the upcoming electric semi-truck and the Model Y SUV.

42,U.S. would destroy banned Russian warheads if necessary: NATO envoy,"Russia must halt its covert development of a banned cruise missile system or the United States will seek to destroy it before it becomes operational, Washington’s envoy to NATO said on Tuesday. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison briefs the media ahead of a NATO defence ministers meeting at the Alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, October 2, 2018. REUTERS/Francois LenoirThe United States believes Russia is developing a ground-launched system in breach of a Cold War treaty that could allow Russia to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice, but Moscow has consistently denied any such violation. U.S. ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said Washington remained committed to a diplomatic solution but was prepared to consider a military strike if development of the medium-range system continued. “At that point, we would be looking at the capability to take out a (Russian) missile that could hit any of our countries,” Hutchison told a news conference. “Counter measures (by the United States) would be to take out the missiles that are in development by Russia in violation of the treaty,” she added. “They are on notice.” Hutchison later clarified in a tweet that she was not talking about a preemptive strike against Russia. “My point: Russia needs to return to INF Treaty compliance or we will need to match its capabilities to protect US & NATO interests. The current situation, with Russia in blatant violation, is untenable.” The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty bans medium-range missiles capable of hitting Europe or Alaska. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States had for some time argued that Moscow was not in compliance with the treaty. “What Ambassador Hutchison was talking about was improving overall defense and deterrence posture,” Nauert told a news conference. “The United States is committed to upholding its arms control obligations and expects Russia to do the very same thing,” she said, adding that the U.S. was discussing the issue with its allies. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that such statements were dangerous, and that it would provide detailed answers to Washington. “It seems that people who make such statements do not realize the level of their responsibility and the danger of aggressive rhetoric,” TASS news agency quoted spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying. In the past, the ministry has said it is ready for talks with the United States to try to preserve the treaty and would comply with its obligations if the United States did. But that same year, the U.S. State Department report found Russia had violated obligations “not to possess, produce, or flight-test” a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles), “or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.”  The U.S. accusations are likely to further strain relations between Moscow and the West that are at a low over Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea, its bombing campaign in Syria and accusations of meddling in Western elections. “We have been trying to send a message to Russia for several years that we know they are violating the treaty; we have shown Russia the evidence that we have that they are violating the treaty,” Hutchison said. “We are laying down the markers so that our allies will help us bring Russia to the table,” she added. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said he would discuss the issue with his NATO counterparts at a scheduled two-day meeting in Brussels from Wednesday. “I cannot forecast where it will go, it is a decision for the president, but I can tell you that both on Capitol Hill and in State Department, there is a lot of concern about this situation and I’ll return with the advice of our allies and engage in that discussion to determine the way ahead,” he told reporters in Paris.

43,Fed's Powell says U.S. outlook 'remarkably positive',"U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday hailed a “remarkably positive outlook” for the U.S. economy that he feels is on the verge of a “historically rare” era of ultra-low unemployment and tame prices for the foreseeable future. It is a view, he said, based on how a changed economy is operating today, with businesses and households immunized by strong central bank policy from the inflationary psychology that caused unemployment, inflation and interest rates to swing wildly in the 1960s and 1970s. It is an outlook that includes an economic performance “unique in modern U.S. data,” with unemployment of below 4 percent expected for at least two more years and inflation remaining modest even as wages rise. And it is an outlook he feels will even survive the Trump administration’s efforts to rewrite the global trading system, a policy shift Powell said may lead to one-time price hikes, but not to persistent changes in the annual rate of inflation going forward.  “This forecast is not too good to be true,” Powell told the National Associate for Business Economics, but instead “is testament to the fact that we remain in extraordinary times.” “These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation.” Asked about the impact of tariffs on inflation, he replied that, so far, “we don’t see that in the data.” Powell spoke as debate among economic analysts and investors has begun turning toward a central question: Will the current low rate of unemployment inevitably doom a near decade-long expansion by driving inflation to levels the Fed will have to suppress with faster and higher than expected rate increases? That’s not the view contained in the Fed’s most recent round of forecasts, which sees a hot job market, steady economic growth, steady 2 percent inflation and only modest rate increases through 2021 - as if the United States had slipped into the sort of pleasant long-run equilibrium described in textbook economic models. SEEDS OF TROUBLE But several economists here argue that the seeds of trouble have already been planted, with companies using the recent tariff hikes on steel and other goods as an excuse to raise prices more generally, and to perhaps keep doing so.  At a time when Amazon announced a nationwide minimum wage increase that could put pressure on other retailers, the administration was trumpeting a trade pact with Mexico and Canada that will steer auto production to higher wage locales, and leaves in place new tariffs on steel, a key industrial input.   Boston Federal Reserve bank president Eric Rosengren said the current debate over globalization was not so much a “trade war” but “more of a supply chain war” that could take years to sort out as companies shift around production to higher-cost locales to escape tariffs on imports from China. “Big importers will tell you it is not that easy to change...It becomes a real risk if all of a sudden you are not sure what your price is going to be,” he said on Monday. Catherine Mann, global chief economist at Citigroup and former chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the spark could be lit early next year. The costs of adjusting to tariffs and to trade uncertainty “gives firms cover to say, ‘I’m going to raise my prices,’” she told the NABE annual conference. “I’m timing it for the beginning of the year,” Mann said, when a windfall from this year’s tax cuts fade. Powell, in his remarks, said the Fed is not blind to the possible “revenge” of prices rising as they have before during times of sustained low unemployment. The central bank is guarding against that with its current, gradual interest rate increases, and will respond “with authority” if an inflationary mindset threatens to take hold. But he noted that many current and past Fed officials, himself among them, had warned in the years following the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis that falling unemployment and the Fed’s printing of trillions of dollars of new money would unhinge inflation at any moment. It never happened, and he said there is no reason now to expect it will.  “I am glad to be able to stand here and say that the economy is strong, unemployment is near 50-year lows, and inflation is roughly at our 2 percent objective,” Powell said. “The baseline outlook for forecasters inside and outside the Fed is for more of the same.” ",Top-Nachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
44,"Trump hails Canada, Mexico trade pact as win for U.S. workers","President Donald Trump on Monday touted a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico as a win for U.S. workers while investors breathed a sigh of relief that the key pillars of NAFTA had survived his hardball strategy to reshape global commerce. Washington and Ottawa reached an agreement on Sunday after weeks of tense bilateral talks to update the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. The United States had forged a separate trade deal with Mexico, the third member of NAFTA, in August. The new agreement, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), is aimed at bringing more jobs into the United States, with Canada and Mexico accepting more restrictive commerce with the United States, their main export customer.       “These measures will support many - hundreds of thousands - American jobs,” Trump said at the White House, describing the trade deal as “the most important” the United States had ever made. “It means far more American jobs, and these are high-quality jobs,”  he said. Trump had repeatedly called NAFTA a terrible deal for the United States. Any U.S. job gains are likely years away, but the deal provides Trump with a victory that he can tout at campaign rallies over the next month on behalf of fellow Republicans running in the Nov. 6 congressional elections. But auto industry officials privately said job gains would be more limited, partly because tighter autos content rules would raise their costs even as the deal eases worries that they would have to tear up supply chains and move existing assembly plants. Praise from the lobbying group representing Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) was measured. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, called the deal “a workable agreement” achieved through a close relationship between the automakers and U.S. negotiators. Speaking in Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  said the deal removed uncertainty, but he conceded that Canada had made some difficult compromises. Canada’s dairy industry criticized him for giving more market access to U.S. imports.  “We had to make compromises, and some were more difficult than others,” Trudeau said at a news conference. “We never believed that it would be easy, and it wasn’t, but today is a good day for Canada.” Verwandte ThemenGermany welcomes U.S., Canada and Mexico trade pactFactbox: Details of the new North America free trade dealTrudeau did win a face-saving preservation of a key trade dispute settlement mechanism to fight U.S. anti-dumping tariffs. Initial U.S. reaction was effusive, with auto workers, dairy farmers and wheat producers saying the deal would likely create job opportunities and open up agricultural markets. A NAFTA collapse could have caused U.S. farmers, a key Trump constituency, to lose access to major agricultural markets in Canada and Mexico at the same time that China has halted purchases of U.S. soybeans and other commodities due to a tariff war. NAFTA underpins about $1.2 trillion in annual trade between its three member countries. U.S., Canadian and Mexican stocks jumped early on Monday before paring gains later. The Canadian dollar CAD=D4 strengthened to a four-month high against the U.S. dollar, while the Mexican peso MXN=D3 rose to near a two-month high against the greenback. EYES ON CHINA The deal ends a major source of trade irritation as the Trump administration pivots to a much bigger fight with China, where U.S. tariffs now are active on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatened on $267 billion more. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, issued a new warning on Monday that rising tariffs were  dimming the global growth outlook.       U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has been working to recruit Japan and the European Union to help pressure China to change its trade, subsidy and intellectual property practices. With a deal that preserves U.S. market access, Canada and Mexico now are more likely to join that effort. While Trump’s goals for revising NAFTA were to shrink U.S. trade deficits, claw back lost manufacturing jobs and add new IP protections and digital trade chapters, the new pact leaves North American trade flows largely unaltered. “The most significant thing about this new deal is that they changed the name,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management. “It really is tweaks to NAFTA.” The deal effectively maintains the auto industry’s current footprint in North America, and spares Canada and Mexico from the prospect of U.S. national security tariffs on their vehicles. Over time it will force auto companies to spend billions of dollars to produce more of their future products in the United States or Canada to meet new requirements that 40 percent to 45 percent of a vehicle’s value content come from high-wage areas. Slideshow (3 Images)Auto makers, particularly from Europe and Asia, may be pushed to move more of their supply chain into the region.   Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, who led his country’s trade negotiations, said the agreement was an attempt to make the region more competitive versus Asia and Europe. “Everyone is trying to entrench themselves in their region to compete with other regions,” Guajardo told Mexican radio. Unifor, Canada’s biggest private sector union, said the deal was likely positive for auto workers, as it requires a much higher percentage of parts to be made in North America, with a significant proportion produced in areas paying at least $16 per hour.  STEEL TARIFFS STAY The deal does not include any changes to separate U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum levied earlier this year on Canada, Mexico, China, the European Union and others. Trump said the those tariffs - 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum - would remain in place for Canada and Mexico until they “can do something different like quotas, perhaps.”  “We are not going to allow our steel industry to disappear,” Trump said, adding that Sunday’s deal would not have happened without the tariffs. Both Trudeau and Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the tariffs needed to be removed before the new trade deal is signed on Nov. 30. Passage of the deal by the U.S. Congress is not expected until the spring of 2019, after November elections could shift control of the House of Representatives to Democrats from Republicans. Some Democrats may be reluctant to give Trump a victory and may oppose the deal, but some of the deal’s stronger rules on labor, autos and the environment may appeal to more liberal Democrats, who often opposed free trade deals in the past. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump “deserves praise for taking large steps” to improve NAFTA, but said he would judge the deal on U.S. dairy access to Canada and “real enforcement of labor provisions.” Mexico’s Guajardo on Monday said the new accord could be signed by the three countries’ leaders when they meet at a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires in late November.

45,"Amazon raises minimum wage to $15, urges rivals to follow","Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees from next month, giving in to critics of poor pay and working conditions at the world’s second most valuable company. The increase pushes Amazon’s lowest wage above that at Walmart Inc and Target Corp. It is almost $3 shy of the average for a non-management worker in warehousing in the United States. The online retailer also said it would now lobby in Washington D.C. for an increase in the federal minimum wage and urged its competitors to follow its lead as the union-led “Fight for Fifteen” movement pushes for higher remuneration. Amazon’s move comes when U.S. unemployment is at a near two-decade low as retailers and shippers compete for hundreds of thousands of workers for the all-important holiday shopping season. Several companies, including United Parcel Service and Macy’s, have announced hiring to staff stores and handle holiday sales and delivery. “We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,” founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement. The pay increase, effective from next month, will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees in the United States as well as over 100,000 seasonal employees who will be hired across the country this holiday season, the company said. Verwandte ThemenSenator Bernie Sanders applauds Amazon for wage hikeAmazon raises minimum wage rates in BritainChristine Owens, executive director at advocacy group National Employment Law Project, said Amazon’s call for changes at the federal level was a “significant” move. “At $7.25, the federal minimum wage is a poverty wage.  Having major, profitable employers like Amazon join the fight could help finally unstick it,” she said. Amazon, which became the second company after Apple to cross $1 trillion in market value last month, currently pays around $11 per hour. Analysts said the raise would cost it $1 billion or less annually but would be offset by a recent $20 increase in the cost of its Prime memberships. “You’ve got a company that can’t attract and keep labor because their wage rates are at the bottom of the pay scale, generally speaking,” said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which closely tracks Amazon’s fulfillment operation.  “This is Amazon waking up and smelling the coffee.” Amazon also said it was ending some restricted stock unit grants as it raised wages for hourly warehouse and customer service employees.  The company’s shares closed down 1.6 percent at $1,971.31 on Tuesday. Workers sort arriving products at an Amazon Fulfilment Center in Tracy, California August 3, 2015.  REUTERS/Robert Galbraith WORKER STRESS U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders credited Amazon on Tuesday for doing the “right thing” and called on other corporations in fast food, airlines and retail industries to follow the retailer in raising wages. Amazon has long been criticized for tough conditions in its fulfillment centers and for its demanding work culture.  That has included several fatalities, including one in 2013 when a conveyer system crushed a temporary worker in a New Jersey warehouse, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  A separate OSHA investigation found that Amazon exposed some workers to stress from repeated exertions, bending and standing for up to 10 hours at a time.  Like several of the big U.S. tech firms, Amazon is also facing increased official scrutiny over how much tax it pays. “With the Trump administration having previously taken aim at Bezos and Amazon, they need to be proactive to position themselves positively in the court of public opinion,” said Tom Gimble, CEO of recruiting firm LaSalle Network.  “With many municipalities raising minimum wage over the next few years to approaching $15 per hour, this was not really a stretch for them to do that.” Target Corp raised its minimum hourly wage last year to $11 and promised to raise it to $15 an hour by the end of 2020, while the world’s largest retailer Walmart raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour earlier this year, even as both struggled with high transportation and raw material costs.

46,Trump administration rejects states' argument on net neutrality,"Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai rejected arguments Monday that states should be able to impose their own net neutrality protections after the Trump administration in December withdrew them. FILE PHOTO: Chairman Ajit Pai speaks ahead of the vote on the repeal of so called net neutrality rules at the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, U.S., December 14, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. BernsteinThe Trump administration late on Sunday filed suit seeking a preliminary injunction to block California’s state net neutrality law from taking effect in January. The court filing came soon after Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation. Pai told reporters after an event in Washington the arguments made by states are “completely baseless” and said the internet is “inherently an interstate service... From a legal perspective we’re on very strong ground.” In August, 22 states, including California, and a coalition of trade groups representing major tech companies urged a federal appeals court to reinstate the rules and said it could not tie states’ hands. “An agency that deems itself to lack statutory authority to regulate a particular practice altogether cannot rely on the same absence of authority to preempt state regulation,” the states wrote. This marks the latest clash between the Trump administration and California, which have sparred over environmental, immigration and other hot-button issues. Senator Ed Markey said Monday, “Despite overwhelming bipartisan support for the open internet, the Trump administration, along with the big broadband behemoths, will stop at nothing to prevent strong net neutrality rules from being put on the books on the state and national levels.” The FCC voted 3-2 in December along party lines to reverse rules that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization. The vote also sought to preempt states from setting their own rules governing internet access. The Trump administration rules were a win for providers like Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, but the net neutrality repeal was opposed by internet companies like Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc. Cox Communications Inc [COXC.UL] President Pat Esser said in an interview Monday that internet providers are committed to an open internet but want flexibility to address consumer needs. Esser said the FCC in 2015 went too far in opening the door to future rate regulation. He hopes Congress will codify open internet rules. ISPs are not going to block or throttle websites. “It’s just not good business practice,” Esser said.  “It’s become a political issue more than a rational issue.” The U.S. Senate voted in May to reinstate net neutrality rules, but the measure is unlikely to be approved by the House of Representatives. The FCC in December handed ISPs sweeping new powers to recast how Americans use the internet, as long as they disclose changes. The new rules took effect in June but providers have made no changes.

47,Trump administration says trade pact will bring auto jobs back to U.S.,"U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross sees tens of thousands of jobs flowing back into the U.S. auto sector, especially among suppliers, thanks to the Trump administration’s new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, while industry executives and analysts are less upbeat as higher costs could hurt sales. FILE PHOTO: A car hauler heading for Detroit, Michigan, drives on the lane to Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, Canada., April 28, 2017. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File PhotoRoss told Bloomberg TV on Monday that “the vast majority” of the 250,000 auto parts jobs lost in the United States would return under the new agreement, which is called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The manufacturing part of U.S. auto sector employed about 950,000 people in August, according to federal data. Ross did not say when the jobs were lost or how long it would take for some to return, but cited the deal requirements for higher regional content and higher wages by the workers making those parts. Commerce Department officials declined further comment. U.S. President Donald Trump blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada for the loss of manufacturing jobs because companies shifted production facilities to lower-cost Mexico.         Almost 18 percent of the world’s cars were made in the three countries in 2017, making North America the third-largest auto-producing region behind China and Europe, according to industry data.      U.S. automakers, including General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), cheered the deal, despite higher costs, because it removed the risk that the disintegration of the pact would have posed to their business model, and provides the security they need to plan investment in future multi-year projects.  Administration and industry officials said the new trade pact will require suppliers to shift some production into the United States and Canada to meet the higher requirements of 75 percent regional content - up from the previous 62.5 percent - and 40 to 45 percent of vehicle value to be built in regions paying at least $16 an hour. Auto executives said privately they thought the rules would require a modest shift of some parts production to the United States, but would not lead to a dramatic shift in employment. The number of U.S. auto parts assembly jobs has dropped to about 577,000 jobs from about 850,000 in 2000 due to higher levels of automation and productivity in plants and a shift to lower-cost countries like Mexico. Today’s employment level is around what it was a decade ago, before the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The crisis prompted the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler, the closing of numerous assembly and parts plants, and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, as well as the U.S. government’s $80 billion industry bailout to prevent deeper cuts.  Automakers in the new trade deal also scored a win when pickup trucks and commercial vehicles were exempted from the new caps, which will especially benefit GM, which builds more than 400,000 trucks annually in Mexico. Fitch Ratings said the pickup exemption “is a nod to the importance of this segment to the U.S. consumer.”     The deal exempts 2.6 million Mexican and 2.6 million Canadian vehicle imports to the United States from punitive 25 percent national security tariffs - significantly above existing exports, indicating there is room for those imports to grow. The deal also caps imported auto parts. The euphoria over the deal was not confined to the U.S. auto sector. Mexican auto parts makers Nemak (NEMAKA.MX) and Rassini (RASSNICPO.MX) as well as industrial conglomerate Alfa (ALFAA.MX), which also makes auto parts, all soared on the news. [nL2N1WH1TG] U.S. labor leaders with the United Auto Workers union and the AFL-CIO also welcomed the new trade pact, but said the details will determine its ultimate success. The UAW said it could “provide some needed relief for America’s working families.” Not all the news is good for automakers as the deal will likely result in higher costs, industry executives and analysts said. The auto provisions will phase in through Jan. 1, 2023. “It will drive the vehicle costs up,” said Samit Ghosh, president of P3 North America, an engineering and management consulting firm with auto clients. He said that could ultimately hurt sales and thus production.  The net effect on employment, however, is not clear, Ghosh added. In addition, the Commerce Department is studying whether imports of cars from around the world are a threat to national security. If Commerce finds that to be the case, the United States could slap tariffs on cars and parts from outside the United States, including from Canada and Mexico after the imported cars and parts covered under the USMCA deal. The Center for Automotive Research in Michigan estimated around 200,000 jobs would be lost in the U.S. economy if the 25 percent tariffs are imposed on imported vehicles and parts from non-NAFTA trading partners, versus 715,000 jobs if imposed on all countries including Canada and Mexico.

48,Mexican auto parts makers see new trade deal boosting output,"Auto parts output in Mexico will jump about 10 percent over the next three years as automakers scramble to adhere to stricter content rules laid out in a new North American trade deal, a top industry executive said on Monday. The United States and Canada reached an agreement on Sunday after weeks of tense bilateral talks to update the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico and the United States first brokered a bilateral accord in late August. The new trilateral deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), will raise the minimum North American content threshold for cars needed to qualify for duty-free market access to 75 percent from 62.5 percent. “Carmakers, especially Asian and European carmakers, will have to invest more in tools, in North American components to comply with the new content rules,” Oscar Albin, head of Mexican auto parts industry association INA, said in an interview. The so-called rules of origin dictate what percentage of a car needs to be built in North America in order to avoid tariffs in the trade deal. General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) Germany’s Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and Honda Motor co (7267.T) all build autos in Mexico. “The American carmakers already have a very well-established footprint in the United States and Mexico” and will more easily adhere to the stricter content rules, Albin told Reuters. The new rules should boost auto parts production from about $90 billion annually at present to “around $100 billion” over the next three years, he added. In the course of that period, the sector should add about 80,000 new jobs, Albin said. Stocks in auto parts firms were lifted by the deal. Shares in Nemak (NEMAKA.MX), the auto parts unit of Mexican industrial conglomerate Alfa (ALFAA.MX), closed up by more than 8.5 percent. Stock in Mexican auto parts maker Rassini (RASSNICPO.MX) rose by more than 4.5 percent. “The United States and Canada will also grow since the three countries will benefit (from the new agreement),” said Albin. The deal set a five-year transition period once the accord enters into force to meet the new content requirements. That looked like a tough deadline, Albin said. “I think (time) is a bit short because any adjustment or change of the supply (chain) for cars already being assembled is practically impossible,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump had put creating more manufacturing jobs at the heart of his desire to rework NAFTA. ",Politik,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

51,U.S. high court mulls death penalty for killer who forgot crime,"U.S. Supreme Court justices, delving into the issue of aging prisoners with dementia, struggled on Tuesday over whether a convicted Alabama murderer should be spared the death penalty because strokes have erased his memory of committing the crime. FILE PHOTO: Vernon Madison, one of Alabama's longest-serving death row inmates, is pictured in this handout photo. Courtesy Alabama Department of Corrections/Handout via REUTERS  Vernon Madison, 68, was convicted and sentenced to death for fatally shooting a Mobile police officer in 1985. During an hour of arguments, the justices heard from both Alabama and Madison’s attorney that severe cognitive decline could preclude a state from executing inmates who cannot understand what was happening to them. But it remained unclear whether the justices will decide Madison fits that criteria.  The justices, on the second day of their new term, must determine whether executing Madison would violate the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. A ruling is due by June. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, a death penalty critic, said there are many aging inmates who, like Madison, have spent decades on death row. “So this will become a more common problem,” Breyer said. The Supreme Court has previously imposed limits on capital punishment for mentally incompetent or intellectually disabled people.  Madison suffered several strokes in recent years, resulting in brain damage, dementia and memory impairment, according to court papers. He is legally blind, cannot walk unassisted and speaks with a slur.  The dispute centers on whether Madison can understand the connection between his crime and the planned punishment. Alabama has said Madison can understand the link. A federal appeals court ruled last year that he cannot.  The justices ruled last year that Alabama could execute Madison, but on Jan. 25 they then halted his execution and a month later agreed to hear his case. Madison shot Julius Schulte, a police officer in Mobile, twice in the back of the head as Schulte supervised Madison’s move out of his former girlfriend’s house, according to court papers. Attorneys for Alabama and Madison told the justices memory loss alone cannot exempt someone from execution.  Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, asked Madison’s attorney Bryan Stevenson whether he conceded that “simply blacking out, you don’t remember the crime” was not enough. “It doesn’t make them incompetent,” Stevenson agreed, but asked the justices to bar execution when “someone has a disability that renders them incapable of orienting to time or place.” Liberal justices including Sonia Sotomayor appeared to agree Madison should be spared, but conservative Justice Samuel Alito noted that experts evaluating the case said Madison understands the meaning of the death sentence and certain other details.  “Nothing about Mr. Madison’s conditions impact the state’s interest in seeking retribution for a heinous crime,” Alabama Deputy Attorney General Thomas Govan said.  The court, one justice short amid the fight over President Donald Trump’s nominee Brett Kavanaugh, is currently split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals. Madison, who is black, was sentenced to death in 1994 in his third trial. His first two convictions were thrown out on appeal for racial discrimination in jury selection and other prosecutorial misconduct.  ",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
52,Trump says close to finalizing effective ban on gun bump stocks,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday his administration is  just a few weeks away from finalizing a regulation that would ban so-called bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns. “We’re knocking out bump stocks,” Trump said at a White House news conference. “We’re in the final two or three weeks, and I’ll be able to write out bump stocks.” A year ago in Las Vegas, gunman Stephen Paddock used bump stocks on 12 of his weapons in a mass shooting that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds. Authorities said his ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute over the course of 10 minutes from his perch in a 32nd-floor hotel suite was a major factor in the high casualty count. While machine guns manufactured after May 1986 are outlawed in the United States, bump stocks are not. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in March the Justice Department was proposing a rule that would effectively ban the devices. In February, Trump had signed a memorandum directing the department to make the regulatory change. The change required a public comment period before taking effect.  “We are now at the final stages of the procedure,” Trump said. ",Politik,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
53,Lack of prep plagued Trump's child separation border policy: watchdog,"The Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border earlier this year was plagued by a lack of preparation, resource shortfalls and communication failures, according to a government audit released on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Immigrant children now housed in a tent encampment under the new ""zero tolerance"" policy by the Trump administration are shown walking in single file at the facility near the Mexican border in Tornillo, Texas, U.S. June 19, 2018.        REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoThe review, conducted by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General, is the first official audit of President Donald Trump’s policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, criminally prosecuting parents and sending their children to shelters and foster homes across the country. Trump administration officials have said the policy, under which some 2,600 children were separated from their parents, was needed to secure the border and deter illegal immigration. Trump was forced to end the policy after widespread public furor over the separations and the chaotic way in which they were conducted, with hundreds of parents deported without their children. The inspector general’s findings “illustrate the difficulties in enforcing immigration laws that are broken and poorly written,” DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said in an emailed statement. “This administration will no longer turn a blind eye to illegal immigration and will continue to refer illegal border crossers for prosecution.” The audit found that hundreds of migrant children were detained for longer than the three-day limit allowed at U.S. Border Patrol facilities, including one who was held for 25 days.  By law, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has very basic holding facilities, is allowed to detain unaccompanied migrant children for up to 72 hours before transferring them to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The audit also found serious issues with how records on separated families were kept. After the separations, the government struggled to “identify, track, and reunify parents and children” in part because technology systems used by agencies within DHS and HHS could not directly share information. Border Patrol agents did not take measures to ensure that young children who could not yet talk could be correctly identified, failing to provide them with identifying wrist bracelets or fingerprinting or photographing most children, the report said. Furthermore, claims by DHS in late June that it had a “central database” containing information for separated parents and children were not backed up by the review. The inspector general “found no evidence that such a database exists,” the report said. As a result, it took DHS “many weeks” to provide the inspector general with basic information on migrant children separated from their parents, and the data, when finally provided, was “incomplete and inconsistent.” According to a court filing by the government on Thursday, 136 children separated under the “zero tolerance” policy remain in government custody and apart from their parents.

54,First lady Melania Trump coos over kids in Ghana on solo Africa trip,"Melania Trump cuddled a baby, handed out teddy bears and beamed smiles on her first day in Africa on Tuesday, kicking off a four-country visit and receiving a warm welcome on a continent her husband once referred to derisively. The U.S. first lady touched down at mid-morning in Ghana’s capital, Accra, where she was greeted by her counterpart, Ghana’s first lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo, and a young girl who offered her flowers. A welcoming ceremony of drums and dancing by men and women dressed in traditional attire followed. Trump clapped her hands for the performers and waved at a group of schoolchildren who had gathered for her at the airport. The trip is Trump’s first major solo outing abroad as first lady. She has accompanied President Donald Trump on foreign visits, but she chose Africa for her first multi-nation trip alone. She will visit Kenya, Malawi and Egypt before returning to the United States at the end of the week.

56,"Japan car makers welcome North America trade deal, but U.S. export curbs a risk","Toyota, Nissan and Mazda welcomed on Tuesday the revised North America trade deal that left Japanese automakers unscathed but they may face a bumpy ride when Washington and Tokyo hold new talks on over $40 billion of annual U.S. auto imports from Japan.     The logo of Mazda Motor Corp. is displayed at the company's news conference venue in Tokyo, Japan May 11, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonThe United States and Canada reached an agreement on Sunday to update the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement after Washington had forged a separate trade deal with Mexico in August. The updated deal effectively maintains the auto industry’s current footprint in North America, and spares Canada and Mexico from the prospect of U.S. national security tariffs on their vehicles. Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T), which ships cars to the United States from Mexico and Japan, called the deal a “big step forward”. Nissan Motor Corp (7201.T), which makes the cars it sells in the United States locally as well as in Mexico, Japan and other countries, said it was “encouraged” by the agreement. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Japan’s biggest automaker, said it was “pleased” that a basic deal was reached. Other automakers were not immediately available for comment. While the deal has removed the risk that the disintegration of the pact would have posed to automakers, bigger risks loom large for Japanese firms as a chunk of the roughly 7 million cars they sold in the U.S. last year were shipped from Japan, and a trade deal between Washington and Tokyo has yet to be agreed.     The United States and Japan last week agreed to begin fresh trade talks, with U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to address Japan’s $69 billion trade surplus, of which nearly two-thirds comes from auto exports. Washington is also investigating the possibility of slapping 25 percent tariffs on auto imports on national security grounds, although it has agreed with Japan to put any new tariffs on hold during the talks. Analysts say the United States may take a tougher stance on auto imports from Japan than from its neighbors. “If Japan requests an exemption from the 25 percent tariffs under consideration, Washington could propose a more strict cap on imports than it agreed to with Mexico and Canada,” said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities. “That would be a risk.” This could be a big blow to Japan, as the United States is a key source of revenue for Japanese automakers including Toyota, Nissan and Honda Motor Co (7267.T). The U.S. market accounts for a quarter or more of their annual global vehicle sales, and of their total U.S. sales, and depending on the automaker, as much as half of those was shipped from Japan last year. A side letter to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), as the new deal agreed on Sunday is called, states that Mexico and Canada would each get a tariff-free passenger vehicle quota of 2.6 million annual export units, well above their current export levels.  “I don’t think that will happen in the case of Japan,” said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama, adding that U.S. automakers, which sell very few cars in Japan, would stand to lose little from any trade barriers with Japan.

59,Trump says too soon to talk with China on trade,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said it was “too soon” for Washington to talk to Beijing about working out a deal on trade, suggesting U.S. tariffs have yet to exert enough pressure to force Beijing into making concessions at the negotiating table. “China wants to talk, very badly, and I said, ‘Frankly, it’s too early to talk.’ Can’t talk now, because they’re not ready,” Trump said during remarks on trade at the White House. “If, politically, people force it too quickly, you’re not going to make the right deal for our workers and for our country.” During his remarks, which focused on a new U.S. trade deal with Canada and Mexico, Trump hailed the power of tariffs he has imposed to bring American trading partners to the table. But he suggested steeps tariffs he has placed on U.S. imports of Chinese products have yet to bend Beijing’s will. “Because they’ve been ripping us for so many years, it doesn’t happen that quickly,” Trump said. The Trump administration slapped tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods last month and is threatening to impose duties on virtually all of the goods China exports to the United States. Trump has said signs of economic weakness in China and its slumping stock markets are proof of the effect U.S. tariffs are having on the Chinese economy. Still, Beijing has remained defiant, vowing to stimulate domestic demand to cushion the blow from any trade shocks.   “They’re having a much more difficult time now,” Trump said. “I don’t want them to have a difficult time.” U.S. President Donald Trump announces the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) as U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross looks on during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 1, 2018.

REUTERS/Fred Thornhill/File PhotoCOMMENTS: JOHN BODE, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE U.S. CORN REFINERS ASSOCIATION: “This is a milestone. Mexican and Canadian markets are very important to American farmers, ranchers, and agribusiness. We commend President Trump for his efforts to conclude this trilateral agreement. We look forward to reviewing the agreement text released today.” RANDY GORDON, CEO NATIONAL GRAIN AND FEED ASSOCIATION (NGFA) AND GARY MARTIN, CEO NORTH AMERICAN EXPORT GRAIN ASSOCIATION (NAEGA)  “Given the integrated nature of the North American economy, including within the food and agricultural sector, it was extremely important to reach a trade agreement that included all three countries.    “Our industry is encouraged about reports that the final agreement takes steps to modify some existing impediments to agricultural trade, including dairy, and will preserve some form of the trilateral Chapter 19 tariff dispute-settlement mechanism contained in the North American Free Trade Agreement. PRESIDENT AND CEO MATTHEW SHAY, THE NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION:    “We are pleased a deal has been reached that preserves NAFTA’s trilateral framework, which is critical to protecting North American supply chains that support millions of American jobs. The administration, as well as officials from Canada and Mexico, should be applauded for months of hard work aimed at modernizing NAFTA for the 21st century —  a goal retailers have shared from the start.” GEOFF FREEMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (GMA)  “U.S. consumers rely on the high-quality ingredients and affordable products made possible through trade with our closest neighbors. This trade has quadrupled since NAFTA went into effect more than two decades ago, totaling nearly $18 billion in 2017. Canada and Mexico buy about half of all U.S. processed product exports, and this agreement will expand that success. MICHAEL DYKES, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE INTERNATIONAL DAIRY FOODS ASSOCIATION, A WASHINGTON GROUP THAT REPRESENTS DAIRY PROCESSORS:  “Having this agreement be trilateral is very important. We are pleased to see the negotiators preserved access with our number one customer, Mexico. For Canada, our priorities included increased market access and my understanding is we did get that. “We are pleased with the negotiators and are pleased with the priority they placed on the dairy industry.”  EDWARD R. HAMBERGER, CHIEF, THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN RAILROADS:  “The free flow of goods across North America without burdensome tariffs is a net positive for U.S. workers, bedrock industries and the economy.” ERIC MEYER, PRESIDENT OF HIGHGROUND DAIRY, CHICAGO: “Nothing but good news here for the US dairy industry. Class 7 milk pricing in Canada caused problems for US manufacturers in two different ways. First, it stopped the flow of ultra-filtered milk, a concentrated skim solids ingredient that was used to boost protein content in cheese and yogurt made in Canada. “Second, the pricing system allowed for Canada to be competitive to export their excess skim milk powder, taking away market share from the US. Eliminating the Canadian Class 7 pricing system could open these markets back up to US processors. Lastly, any further opening of the Canadian market to general imports is helpful to the US dairy industry. While exact details of the agreement between Canada and the United States have yet to be released, there is nothing at the core of the agreement that looks bearish to the US dairy industry and should lead to a boost in export demand for US dairy products.”  DON ROOSE, PRESIDENT OF U.S. COMMODITIES, AN IOWA-BASED AG BROKERAGE AND ADVISORY FIRM: “It opens up the trade for a lot of different agricultural products. I don’t know if (the USMCA) was a surprise; it was definitely a positive for all the ag markets, for the psychology of the markets. Pushing forward to the EU and Japan talks – those are probably as dominant (for the market) as NAFTA.” SHAUN OSBORNE, CHIEF FX STRATEGIST, SCOTIABANK, TORONTO “Looking at the price action last week the Canadian dollar outperformed, so there may have been some inkling in the markets that with this sort of self-imposed deadline that we had at the end of September that we could get something or should get something, but we have run into a lot of those soft deadlines before and nothing of consequence has happened. I don’t know that anyone was overly convinced that we would get something necessarily this weekend but I think most people viewed a trade arrangement would be bound at some point. “The good news is that the risk of bad news has been removed. I don’t think there’s anything here that really changes the medium term outlook for the Canadian dollar or the Canadian economy, it’s just removed an uncertainty.”  DAVID KELLY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN FUNDS, NEW YORK:  “The most significant thing about this new deal is that they changed the name. Reading it, it really is tweaks to NAFTA, but at least some of them in a positive direction from the economic perspective. It really is very small changes to the underlying framework of North American trade, but that’s a positive. There’s only downside to a trade war. To the extent we avoided a trade war in this hemisphere at least that is a positive. “The fact that having made a very big deal about Nafta during the elections but then agreed to a deal which only changes small parts of it does say something about the potential end game for trade talks with China. There is a limit to how much China will compromise in the end, a limit to how much we will need them to compromise in the end. After all the U.S. trade deficit is primarily caused by a too-high U.S. dollar and a big deficit.”   OLIVER PURSCHE, CEO OF BRUDERMAN BROTHERS IN NEW YORK:  “Obviously this is a positive step forward, it’s one more box to tick. Overall, markets and investors are very much focused on economic policy and the upcoming earnings season and ignoring everything coming out of Washington. But given that last week it was looking to be more of a Mexico-US deal as opposed to a trilateral deal, it’s a positive development. It shows investors that in spite of an unconventional approach, the President’s hard tactics seem to be working.”  MIKE LORIZIO, SENIOR FIXED INCOME TRADER AT MANULIFE ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK:  “There is a pretty significant risk-on tone following the new NAFTA agreement.  “However, an eventual agreement was priced in, or at least a non-disaster scenario was priced in. The market was more focused on the risk of a trade war with China than any other area and the market has been positioned accordingly. And even with China, the market has discounted what impact any trade negotiations will have on the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. “This is a positive, and you’ve seen risk assets respond, and you’ve seen Treasuries respond a bit, but U.S. fundamentals are so strong right now that the effects of these negotiations had already been priced in.   RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN, TEXAS:  “Anything positive relating to trade has always buoyed the markets so it’s not surprising to see a bounce. Generally those things are relatively short lived but the economics in the market are very strong and really only the concerns about the trade issues have been holding the market back from moving higher.” ALEC YOUNG, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL MARKETS RESEARCH, FTSE RUSSELL IN NEW YORK:  “Stocks are rallying on the back of a last-minute deal Sunday that allows Canada to join the revised NAFTA Trade deal agreed to by the US and Mexico in late August. Despite all the handwringing over trade, the bark is proving far worse than the bite for U.S. stocks.  “Although the trade outlook with China remains uncertain, overall trade uncertainty has been receding for months helping propel stocks to record highs. And even when it comes to China many investors are betting there’s room for a market friendly compromise after the U.S. midterm elections in early November when the Chinese will have an incentive to deal to avoid the 25 percent tariff rate that kicks in on $200 billion in Chinese exports on January 1, 2019.

61,U.S. military comes to grips with over-reliance on Chinese imports,"A Pentagon-led review ordered by President Donald Trump has identified hundreds of instances where the U.S. military depends on foreign countries, especially China, for critical materials, U.S. officials said.     The study is expected to be released in the coming weeks and aims to lessen the U.S. military’s reliance on foreign countries and strengthen U.S. industry.      Among the study’s conclusions will be a determination the United States is too dependent on foreign suppliers for a range of items including some micro-electronics, tiny components such as integrated circuits and transistors, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.      These kinds of essential components are embedded in advanced electronics used in everything from satellites and cruise missiles to drones and cellphones. The focus on China reflects an effort under Trump to address the risks to U.S. national security from Beijing’s growing military and economic clout. Pentagon officials want to be sure China is not able to hobble America’s military by cutting off supplies of materials or by sabotaging technology it exports. The report could add to mounting trade tensions with China, bolstering the Trump administration’s “Buy American” initiative, which aims to help drum up billions of dollars more in arms sales for U.S. manufacturers and create more jobs. Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Pentagon spokesman, did not comment on the contents of the report but told Reuters the study would make recommendations “to ensure a robust, resilient, secure and ready manufacturing and defense industrial base.” China, which has also become the main supplier of many of the rare earth minerals used by the United States, will be given special emphasis in the report, said the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.      A January analysis from the United States Geological Survey said the United States produced no rare earth minerals in 2017 while China accounted for 81 percent of global mine production. Rare earth minerals are used in magnets, radars and consumer electronics.  Aside from the risk that a foreign power could cut off vital supplies needed to keep the U.S. military up and running, other risks include the threat of sabotaged equipment or espionage.  The Pentagon has long fretted that “kill switches” could be embedded in transistors that could turn off sensitive U.S. systems in a conflict. U.S. intelligence officials also warned this year about the possibility China could use Chinese-made mobile phones and network equipment to spy on Americans.      When the study is released, it will not provide a detailed inventory of all of the weaknesses in the supply chain. These will be in a classified annex. A U.S. official said the report will also examine U.S. shortcomings that contribute to purchases from foreign companies, including roller-coaster U.S. defense budgets that make it difficult for companies to predict government demand. Another weakness is in U.S. science and technology education.  BOLSTERING U.S. INDUSTRY     Advocates of the study say it is a late but critical look at ways to address America’s loss of manufacturing, whose toll on national security gets far less attention than the jobs lost, and the political wave that it created in rust-belt states that helped elect Trump president in 2016.     “People used to think you could outsource the manufacturing base without any repercussions (on national security). But now we know that’s not the case,” said one U.S. official familiar with the report, speaking on condition of anonymity.      One aspect of the report’s recommendation is expected to be ensuring profitability for niche U.S. producers of critical components in American weaponry.     Ellen Lord, the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer, has publicly spoken in recent weeks about the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950, which allows the U.S. president to incentivize domestic producers of critical materials through purchase commitments and other guarantees.     Lord said the government should step in to offer such support if businesses would be unable to ensure a “reasonable profit.”    The U.S. Government Accountability Office offered one example in a report last year about how the U.S. military had to  fund a U.S. factory in 2014 to produce the chemical Butanetriol, used in the Hellfire air-to-surface missile. For the previous six years, the military relied on China for the chemical. ",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
62,Volkswagen terminates Audi CEO's contract amid emissions probe,"Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has terminated Audi (NSUG.DE) CEO Rupert Stadler’s contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions cheating by the German group. Munich prosecutors are investigating Stadler and another member of Audi’s senior management for suspected fraud and false advertising related to illegal emissions by its cars and manipulation of vehicle tests. The departure of Stadler came as the German government presented a plan to cut pollution from diesel vehicles in the country’s continuing efforts to negotiate the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal that surfaced three years ago. Stadler is leaving his posts as management board member of the Volkswagen group and as CEO of Audi with immediate effect, VW said in a statement. He had been suspended after he was taken into custody in mid-June on suspicion of interfering with an emissions investigation. Sales executive Bram Schot is acting as interim replacement. Both VW and premium brand Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise. “Mr. Stadler is (leaving) because, due to his ongoing pre-trial detention, he is unable to fulfil his duties as a member of the management board and wishes to concentrate on his defense,” VW said in its statement on Tuesday. PIECH CONFIDANT Following his arrest, Munich prosecutors said that Stadler, the most senior active VW official to be remanded in custody since the scandal broke, was being held on fears he might hinder their investigation. Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of the group’s controlling Piech clan. A statement from acting Audi chief Schot thanked Stadler for his 11 years at the helm, noting that the company had almost doubled its sales in that time and that Stadler had also pushed for development of electric cars. Peter Mosch, works council chief and deputy head of Audi’s supervisory board, said the move gave the company more clarity for the future. In July Volkswagen recruited BMW (BMWG.DE) engine development and purchasing expert Markus Duesmann, who has been touted as a potential successor to Stadler as VW looks for clean-engine expertise to help it to shake off the scandal. A source familiar with the matter said that severance payment terms for Stadler would depend on the investigators’ findings. Stadler’s VW contract was due to run to the end of next year and his Audo CEO contract to the end of 2023. ",Top-Nachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
63,Carmakers and green groups see flaws in German diesel plan,"The German government presented plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes, prompting objections from environmental groups and grudging concessions from the industry. FILE PHOTO: Greenpeace environmental activists protest in front of Germany's Federal Administrative Court before it decides whether German law provides a legal basis for cities to ban diesel cars to help reduce air pollution, in Leipzig, Germany February 27, 2018. The placards read: ""Health risk."" REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschAfter marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of her coalition partners announced in the early hours of Tuesday they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in the worst-affected German cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans. Owners of millions of older diesel vehicles in Germany’s 14 most polluted cities should be able to choose between trade-in sweeteners and hardware upgrades for their vehicles. Carmakers, however, did not all commit to covering the cost of retrofits, as the hardware fixes are known, which could run into billions of euros. They said instead the focus should be on encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at discounted prices. Daimler (DAIGn.DE) gave arguably the strongest backing, saying it was prepared to participate in the retrofit program and offering incentives of up to 10,000 euros ($11,564) for those swapping old cars for new Mercedes models. “We are convinced that emissions of nitrogen oxide can be controlled in cities with modern diesel and without driving bans,” said Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche, referring to diesel byproducts that can cause respiratory ailments. BMW also said it would offer a trade-in incentive of 6,000 euros in the most polluted parts of the country. France’s Renault (RENA.PA) said earlier on Tuesday it was offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives of up to 10,000 euros if they bought new cars. OBJECTIONS However, the chief executive of France’s PSA Group (PEUP.PA) said the retrofit approach “doesn’t work”, although the trade-in approach was more viable. Verwandte ThemenVolkswagen says Germany must ensure all carmakers are on board for diesel retrofitsOpel rejects hardware retrofits for diesel vehicles in Germany“Who’s going to pay is not clear. We believe it’s not the carmakers’ responsibility because at the time when those cars were sold they met all legal requirements,” Carlos Tavares told Reuters at the Paris Motor Show.   The government cannot force the carmakers to pay for hardware upgrades, but shares an interest with the industry in preventing further driving bans for polluting cars, which have already been imposed in Hamburg and are planned for Frankfurt and Stuttgart, the home of Germany’s car industry. On the other side of the argument, green groups argued that the government should have been tougher on the industry, three years after the “dieselgate” scandal broke out at Volkswagen. Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown. Environmental groups have been heartened by a court ruling in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars. “Driving bans will not be avoided with this double failure to come up with a solution,” said Juergen Resch, managing director of environmental group DUH, noting upcoming rulings in a number of major cities. BIG INVESTMENT Ministers were keen to trumpet a deal that they said would mean a big investment by carmakers in getting drivers into cleaner cars. “We are talking about a significant billion (euro) contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,” Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said. German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said that the car industry should take the chance of avoiding driving bans. “My impression is that the car industry has a big interest in restoring the image of diesel,” she said.  Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather than a trade-in, and raised practical objections over the plan. FILE PHOTO: A traffic sign, which ban diesel cars is pictured at the Max-Brauer Allee in downtown Hamburg, Germany, May 31, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File PhotoVolkswagen said whether retrofits were possible would depend on suppliers developing systems that were good enough, and it did not commit to covering the cost of hardware upgrades. Costs for the industry could be as high as 12.5 billion euros, estimated Stefan Bratzel, director of Germany’s Center of Automotive Management. “If around 2.5 million vehicles take up retrofits or trade-in incentives with costs between 2,500 and 5,000 euros, the total cost would be between 6.3 and 12.5 billion euros,” he said.   There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4 standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5 million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from the German KBA transport authority. END OF THE ROAD? Environmental group Greenpeace accused the industry of exploiting the situation. “The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,” it said.

64,"Indonesia steps up race to find survivors as quake toll passes 1,200","Indonesia is in a race against time to save victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi island, the government said on Tuesday, as the official death toll rose to more than 1,200 and looting fueled fears of lawlessness. Four days after the double disaster struck, officials feared the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead had come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Some remote areas have been largely cut off after Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake triggered tsunami waves, destroying roads and bridges, and their losses have yet to be determined. “The team is racing against time because it’s already D+four,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta, referring to four days since the quake. He said rescuers had reached all four of the badly affected districts, which together have a population of 1.4 million, but     he declined to give an estimate of casualties. He gave few details of the conditions rescuers had found, saying they were similar to those in Palu. Earlier, President Joko Widodo called for reinforcements in the search for survivors saying everyone had to be found. The official death toll surged to 1,234 with 800 people seriously injured. There has been particular concern about Donggala, a district of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, which only a few aid workers have managed to reach. Nugroho said it had been “devastated” by the tsunami. Verwandte ThemenAt Indonesia hotel destroyed by quake, hunt for survivors goes onExplainer: What is liquefaction?A video from the district, broadcast by the Antara state news agency, showed widespread destruction, including flattened buildings and a ship hurled into port buildings by the tsunami. “What we need is food, water, medicine, but to up now we’ve got nothing,” said an unidentified man standing in ruins. In Palu, tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) smashed into the beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins.  About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Before-and-after satellite pictures showed a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu’s airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction.  Nugroho said Sigi district was “flattened” by liquefaction.     Among the dead were 34 children killed at a Christian bible study camp. LEAVING AND LOOTING More than 65,000 homes were damaged and more than 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help. Thousands of people have been streaming out of stricken areas. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s damaged airport but military aircraft have taken some survivors out. Many more want to leave. The government has ordered that aid be airlifted in but there’s little sign of help on Palu’s shattered streets and survivors appeared increasingly desperate. A Reuters news team saw a shop cleared by about 100 people, shouting, scrambling and fighting each other for items including clothes, toiletries, blankets and water. Many people grabbed diapers while one man clutched a rice cooker as he headed for the door. Non-essential goods were scattered on the floor amid shards of broken glass.

REUTERS/Athit PerawongmethaPolice were at the scene but did not intervene. The government has played down looting saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated. Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. It has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when an earthquake struck Lombok island. A spokesman for the main U.N. aid coordinating agency, OCHA, said humanitarian agencies were in contact with the government and ready to help. “There is an immediate need for food, clean water, shelter, medical care and psycho-social support,” the spokesman, Jens Laerke, told a briefing in Geneva. State port operator Pelindo IV said a ship carrying 50 tonnes of supplies including rice and baby milk had arrived in Palu on Monday. It was unclear if the aid had been distributed. ‘BURIED FAST’ Power has yet to be restored and aftershocks have rattled nerves but rescuers in Palu held out hope they could still save lives. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa as he pored over its blueprints. About 50 people were believed to have been caught inside the hotel when it was brought down. About nine bodies have been recovered and three rescued alive. Elsewhere, on the outskirts of Palu, lorries brought 54 bodies to a mass grave. Most had not been claimed, a policeman said, but some relatives came to pay respects to loved ones at the 50-meter (165 ft) trench. Rosmawati Binti Yahya, 52, was still looking for her missing daughter. But her husband was among the victims laid in the grave.

66,FBI talks with school friend of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh,"Days after being ordered to look into sexual misconduct allegations against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI has talked with his high school friend Mark Judge, but the interview is not complete, his attorney said on Monday. University professor Christine Blasey Ford has said Judge was a witness when Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her at a party in 1982 when they were high school students in Maryland. Judge has denied Ford’s allegations. Kavanaugh has also denied her accusations, as well as those of two other women, while accusing Democrats of a political “hit.”  Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Friday in favor of Kavanaugh’s nomination but a full Senate vote on confirmation was delayed for a week after President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate members of his Republican Party for the FBI probe. Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the top U.S. court, said on Monday the FBI would have free rein to interview any witnesses it deemed necessary. He said he did not want the probe to become a “witch hunt” and that it should be completed quickly. “I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation. Whatever that means, according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority, I want them to do that,” Trump said at a White House news conference. Verwandte ThemenEmboldened protesters step up effort to block Kavanaugh confirmationHis remarks followed criticism by Democrats that he and other Republicans were trying to limit the scope of the FBI probe. Democratic Senator Chris Coons told reporters he was in discussions with the White House on the probe. “The FBI needs to be allowed to pursue all reasonable investigatory steps from the credible allegations in front of the committee,” he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would vote this week on Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge in Washington. A spokesman for McConnell declined to clarify whether McConnell was referring to procedural votes or a final vote on confirming Kavanaugh. The Kavanaugh nomination erupted last month into a major controversy that jeopardized an effort by Trump and his fellow Republicans to cement conservative dominance of the nation’s highest court and push America’s judiciary to the right. The nomination has become a politically explosive issue just weeks before Nov. 6 elections, when control of Congress is at stake. Some Republicans fear that pushing ahead with confirmation would alienate women voters, while Democrats seek to capitalize. ‘WE REQUEST YOUR PATIENCE’ Judge’s attorney, Barbara “Biz” Van Gelder, said in a statement: “Mr. Judge has been interviewed by the FBI but his interview has not been completed. We request your patience as the FBI completes its investigation.” Ford said during her testimony at a dramatic Senate hearing on Thursday that Judge was in the bedroom where the alleged assault by Kavanaugh occurred. She said Judge and Kavanaugh were both drunk at the time.

Win McNamee/Pool via REUTERS/File PhotoJudge has written several books, including one titled “Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk,” and another titled “God and Man at Georgetown Prep: How I Became a Catholic Despite 20 Years of Catholic Schooling.” He and Kavanaugh were classmates at Georgetown Preparatory School, an elite private school outside Washington. P.J. Smyth, identified by Ford as being at the gathering of teenagers where the alleged assault occurred, was interviewed by the FBI and again denied knowledge of the gathering or of improper conduct by his friend Kavanaugh, Smyth’s lawyers said. Kavanaugh’s second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, has also been interviewed by the FBI, said Coons, who played a key role along with Republican Jeff Flake last week in winning the one-week Senate pause. Texts between friends of Kavanaugh suggest that he and his team tried to refute Ramirez’s claim before it became public, NBC News reported, citing the messages. Reuters was unable to verify the report or reach the people named.  Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for the third woman, Julie Swetnick, told CNN on Monday his client had not been contacted by the FBI. Nine of 10 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote on Monday to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House Counsel Don McGahn, listing 24 people they said should be interviewed by the FBI and urging that the investigation assess all three allegations of sexual misconduct. Supreme Court nominations require Senate confirmation. Trump’s Republicans control the Senate by a 51-49 margin. That means if all the Democrats vote against Kavanaugh, Trump could not afford to have more than one Republican oppose his nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote. Slideshow (7 Images)Trump said he believed Kavanaugh did not lie during his Judiciary Committee testimony about the extent of his drinking in high school and college. On the other hand, Trump said, if the FBI uncovers something, “I’ll take that into consideration. I have a very open mind.” Trump did not elaborate. Chad Ludington, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh, said in a media statement the judge was not truthful during his Senate testimony last week about his drinking and that Kavanaugh was “a frequent drinker and a heavy drinker” at Yale who often got belligerent and aggressive when drunk.

67,"At Indonesia hotel destroyed by quake, hunt for survivors goes on","In a tent next to the crumpled ruins of the Roa Roa hotel in Indonesia’s quake-hit city of Palu, relatives and friends of guests believed to be under the rubble await news as a desperate rescue effort goes on in the intense heat.       A rescue team member walks in front of the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel after earthquake hit in Palu, Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, October 2, 2018. REUTERS/BeawihartaFour days after a 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami struck the coastal town on Sulawesi island, only three people have been pulled out alive from the ruined hotel, and nine bodies have been recovered. About 50 people were believed to have been in the eight-storey building when the disaster struck. A search and rescue team is using acoustic detectors to try to pick up any sounds from trapped survivors, as well as concrete and metal cutters, and saws. “We’re using sound detectors that can pick up voices and knocking. All this takes time but it’s for safety reasons, for survivors and for our own team,” said rescue team head Agus Haryono. An earth digger and crane arrived only on Monday because of difficult road access.   “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside. We are working with that in mind at the moment,” said Haryono, as he pored over blueprints of the building.   Among the group waiting for news, was Assegaf Umar, who was among a team of paragliders who had traveled to Palu to soar above its picturesque bay and steep green hillsides. Umar, who escaped harm because he was staying at a different hotel, was clinging to hope that some of his fellow paragliders staying at the hotel might still be found alive. “Even though by this time, after such an event, the body’s ability to endure is minimal ... we must remain optimistic,” Umar told Reuters. The bodies of three of paragliders have been found, while another four, including a South Korean, were believed to missing beneath the rubble.  Rescuers on Tuesday retrieved the body of Ardi Kurniawan, who was well known among international paragliders. Kurniawan had recently competed in the 2018 Asian Games held in Indonesia, and his team had won bronze medals at the 2017 and 2018 Paragliding World Accuracy Cup.     “We had gathered for a weekend festival and we were looking forward because this place is very beautiful and challenging. I am so sad that this happened,” said Umar.  The paragliders were in Palu for an annual festival in the capital of Central Sulawesi province, three days of arts, cultural events and sports. One paraglider who lost his life, 20-year-old Gleen Mononutu, posted a photo on social media of himself soaring near cloud-topped hills on Sept. 28, the day the earthquake struck, along with a map of a flight path over Palu. Another victim, Petra Mandagi, also posted a photograph of himself wearing an orange helmet and paragliding over Palu bay before disaster struck. It was unclear when the photo was taken. “After bad weather and task stop yesterday, I can reach goal today,” he said in the caption accompanying the pictures on Instagram. Mandagi’s friends and family replied in the comment section of the last photo, asking about his whereabouts after the disaster. Later, many posted condolence messages. “RIP Petra, a skydive mate, a good friend,” said @ivykriyatavi. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
68,"One year later, Las Vegas honors 58 killed in mass shooting","As white doves flew overhead - each tagged with a name of one of the 58 people killed a year ago on Monday when a sniper opened fire in Las Vegas - loved ones gathered at sunrise to remember victims of the largest mass shooting in modern American history. Governor Brian Sandoval commended his state for its struggle to heal and recover at the commemoration ceremony held at an outdoor amphitheater. “From that day of Nevada infamy, we have become #VegasStronger,” he tweeted after the ceremony. Gunman Stephen Paddock, 64, fired over 1,100 rounds from his 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay into a crowd of 22,000 people at an outdoor country music festival on Oct. 1, 2017, in the massacre that also wounded over 800 people. He then killed himself before police stormed his room. At the daybreak ceremony one year later, friends and family members of those slain or wounded bowed their heads for 58 seconds of silence before a choral group sang “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and the air filled with the mournful strains of bagpipes. “On October 1st, our city was jolted into darkness,” Mynda Smith, whose sister Neysa Tonks, a 46-year-old mother of three, was among those gunned down, told the remembrance ceremony. “None of us will ever be the same after that night. However, none of us were alone,” Smith said, recalling the massive response of citizens donating blood, aiding the injured and feeding families stunned by the violence. “We found love that came from so many that were there to help us.”  First responders and others fold an American flag following a prayer service during the one-year anniversary of the October 1 mass shooting, in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 1, 2018.  REUTERS/Steve Marcus     SYMPATHY FROM MGM RESORTS MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay and drew criticism for countersuing victims to seek immunity from damage claims, expressed solidarity and sympathy on the anniversary of the gun violence. Across the country, iHeartRadio’s country music stations held a moment of silence at 10:05 a.m. PDT. The shooting erupted a year ago at 10:05 p.m. PDT. Country singer Jason Aldean, who was performing at the Route 91 Harvest festival when Paddock opened fire on the crowd, posted an image of a historic Las Vegas street sign and the emblem for the Route 91 festival. “Thinkin about our Route 91 family today. #vegasstrong,” Aldean wrote. An investigation into the shooting concluded in August without discovering a motivation for the shooting. Paddock used “bump stock” devices to accelerate the rate of fire from his semiautomatic rifles, effectively turning them into machine guns, which are legal under U.S. law. Within days of the shooting, National Rifle Association leaders urged the U.S. government to review the law, drawing criticism from some members who viewed it as a betrayal of the powerful gun lobby’s principles. On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had submitted a proposed ban on bump stocks to the Office of Management and Budget for review. President Donald Trump, asked about bump stocks at a news conference on Monday, said his administration would try to ensure the devices would be illegal within a matter of weeks.  “We’re knocking out bump stocks,” Trump said. “Bump stocks are done – I told the NRA.” Slideshow (19 Images)",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
69,Bill allowing U.S. to sue OPEC drawing renewed interest,"With oil prices hitting fresh four-year highs, long-dormant proposals to allow the United States to sue OPEC nations are getting a fresh look in Congress, though they were once considered a longshot to becoming law. A U.S. Senate subcommittee on Wednesday will hear testimony on the so-called No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, which would revoke the sovereign immunity that has long shielded OPEC members from U.S. legal action.  The bill would change U.S. antitrust law to allow OPEC producers to be sued for collusion; it would make it illegal to restrain oil or gas production or set those prices - removing sovereign immunity that U.S. courts have ruled exists under current law. Past U.S. leaders have opposed the NOPEC bill, but the possibility of its success may have increased due to President Donald Trump’s frequent criticism of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and as some predict that Brent crude, the international benchmark, could reach $100 a barrel before long.  “OPEC is a pet peeve for him,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Potomac Research. “Everybody thinks he could easily support NOPEC.” Saudi Arabia is lobbying the U.S. government to prevent the bill’s passage, sources familiar with the matter said. Business groups and oil companies also oppose the bill, citing the possibility of retaliation from other countries. OPEC controls output from member nations by setting production targets. Prices are up 82 percent following the cartel’s decision to cut output at the end of 2016, hitting $84 a barrel on Monday, and lawmakers have trained their ire on the group, saying it is again harming consumers and represents interference in free markets. Wednesday’s hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights could give insight into the executive branch’s stance, McMonigle said. One of the witnesses will be Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, who has written in support of such legislation.  A version of NOPEC passed both houses of Congress in 2007 but was shelved after President George W. Bush said he would veto the legislation. Chances of passage this year are slim, as the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to be in session only 16 days the rest of this year, leaving little time for anything but must-do legislation like keeping the government funded. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, is worried that NOPEC could turn into another Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) law, which allows victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States to sue Riyadh, the sources said. The JASTA law is seen as key to why state-run Saudi Aramco was hesitant in publicly listing its shares on U.S. markets in an IPO that has since been shelved.  With close to $1 trillion in investments in the United States, Riyadh has a lot to lose if NOPEC becomes law. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih raised concerns about it with U.S. officials, including U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, during private meetings in recent months, two sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Earlier this year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute told Congress they opposed the bill, saying surging U.S. energy output had mitigated OPEC’s influence.      Since the U.S. renewed sanctions on Iran this May, other nations, including Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase production. However, that has not yet stopped oil’s upward climb.

74,China condemns U.S. for South China Sea freedom of navigation operation,"China expressed anger on Tuesday after a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the disputed South China Sea, saying it resolutely opposed an operation that it called a threat to its sovereignty. Beijing and Washington are locked in a trade war in which they have imposed increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other’s imports. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the destroyer the USS Decatur traveled within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson Reefs in the Spratly Islands on Sunday. The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate. China’s Defence Ministry said a Chinese naval ship had been sent to warn the U.S. vessel to leave. The ministry said China has irrefutable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and the waters around them, and the situation there is progressing well thanks to the hard work of China and countries in Southeast Asia. “The U.S. side repeatedly sends military ships without permission into seas close to South China Seas islands, seriously threatening China’s sovereignty and security, seriously damaging Sino-U.S. military ties and seriously harming regional peace and stability,” the ministry said. “China’s military is resolutely opposed to this,” it said. The Chinese armed forces will continue to take all necessary steps to protect the country’s sovereignty and security, the ministry said. China’s Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement it strongly urged the United States to stop such “provocative” actions and to “immediately correct its mistakes”. The operation also comes as military ties between the two countries have dived, with China also angered by U.S. sanctions on China’s military for buying Russian arms and by U.S. support for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday he did not see relations between the United States and China worsening, a day after his trip to China was canceled. Reuters reported on Sunday that China canceled a security meeting with Mattis that had been planned for October. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis was no longer going to China. China has not yet commented on the matter.

75,Emboldened protesters step up effort to block Kavanaugh confirmation,"U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struggled to get through a terminal at a Washington airport on Monday as protesters confronted him, asking if he believed sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  “How many stories of sexual violence do you need to hear in order to believe women?” one woman asked McConnell, a Republican, as he walked toward an escalator at Reagan National Airport, his aides trying to clear his path, according to video circulated on social media. For some key Republican U.S. senators, no matter where they appeared in the country, newly emboldened protesters, mostly women, were there as well, after being credited with helping force at least a week’s delay in the confirmation vote for Kavanaugh. President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the top U.S. court. Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the lifetime post would cement the conservative grip on the Supreme Court. The activists behind the protests said they planned to keep up the effort as the FBI investigates accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh when he was in high school and college.  Kavanaugh denies the allegations and has accused Democrats of a political “hit.” The allegations against Kavanaugh come against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault that has toppled a succession of powerful men.  “We are still here, still outraged,” said Rachel Carmon, chief operation officer of Women’s March. The group is planning a “Cancel Kavanaugh” march on Thursday beginning at the federal appeals court in Washington on which he sits. Hundreds of protesters rallied on Monday at Boston’s City Hall where Senator Jeff Flake was speaking at a conference, their chants audible in the distance as the Arizona Republican was asked about his dramatic decision last week to press for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. Demonstrators hold signs during a protest and march against the U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in New York City, New York, U.S., October 1, 2018.  REUTERS/Jeenah MoonTwo women had challenged him on Friday as he tried to close a Senate elevator door, confronting him with details of their own experiences of sexual assault and castigating him for announcing he would vote for Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Flake acknowledged on Monday that the incident, aired widely, helped lead to his request at the subsequent committee hearing that an FBI probe be conducted before a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh. Trump, who had previously rebuffed Democratic demands for such an investigation, granted the request. “That experience, as well as a lot of others,” Flake said at the conference when asked if the confrontation motivated his decision. “I got calls and emails and texts from women I never thought I’d hear from in this regard saying: ‘Here’s what happened to me when I was young, here’s what happened to me 30 years ago.’” Flake, a frequent critic of Trump, is not seeking re-election this year.   FOCUS ON UNDECIDED SENATORS Flake’s move came a day after a jarring Senate hearing on Thursday in which university professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when both were high school students in Maryland. Two other women besides Ford have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while he was a young man. He denounced the allegations during his testimony as a political smear driven by Democrats. Protesters have also focused on two other senators who are undecided on Kavanaugh - moderate Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Rallies are being organized every day this week outside Collins’ district office in Portland, Maine, said Amy Halsted, co-director of Maine’s People’s Alliance.  Starting on Tuesday, scores of protesters also planned to deliver morning cups of coffee to Senate offices with messages from victims of sexual assault to encourage them to “wake up to the truth,” the Center for Popular Democracy advocacy group said. Demand Justice, a new group focused on fighting efforts to tilt the U.S. judiciary to the right, said it was spending $120,000 to air a television ad in Washington, Alaska, Maine and the San Francisco area, where Ford lives.

78,"Too much oil? Texas boom outpaces supply, transport networks","The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution have overwhelmed the region’s infrastructure with oil production -driving up costs, depressing regional oil prices and slowing the pace of growth. The U.S. government continues to forecast the country’s oil output rising to fresh record. But competition for limited resources in Texas is making it harder for shale producers to turn a profit and encouraging some to invest elsewhere. Texas is home to the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field and the center of the country’s shale industry. In the past three years, production from the Permian has risen a whopping 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to 3.43 million bpd. All that oil means pipelines from the shale patch are full, so producers are paying more to transport oil on trucks and rail cars. Shortages of labor, water and even the fuel used in fracking are driving up production costs. At the same time, Permian producers are getting less for their oil, which in August traded as much as $17 a barrel below the U.S. crude benchmark. Sellers have to offer the discount to compensate for the higher transport costs. “We’re our own worst enemy,” said Ross Craft, chief executive of Approach Resources, a small west Texas oil producer which last year averaged about 11,600 barrels of oil equivalent daily output. “We can drill, bring these wells on so quickly that we basically outpace the market. It is going to take a little bit of time,” he said, for the infrastructure to catch up to producers. Approach Resources is leaving some wells uncompleted. That means the firm drills the wells, but does not fracture the rock to produce the oil. Other shale producers are also leaving the oil in the ground, waiting for higher prices to make the drilling more profitable. The number of uncompleted wells in the Permian jumped by 80 percent to 3,630 in August compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy Department data. For the rest of the United States, uncompleted wells are up 10 percent from the same period a year ago.  Some companies are reducing the scope of their operations in the Permian. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO.O) each moved a Permian drilling rig to another oilfield, and Conoco idled a second, the companies have said. Noble Energy (NBL.N) also has cut back on its well completions and said it is moving some drilling resources to Colorado. Global Drilling Partners, a drilling contractor based in the Woodlands near Houston, was set to drill seven wells with a Permian operator this July, but that has dropped to two wells starting in December due to lack of pipeline takeaway, said John Hopkins, a managing partner at the company.  “There will be a shift out of West Texas temporarily until they can solve their midstream problems,” he said. Companies are looking to boost their drilling in other fields in Texas, Colorado and Oklahoma, he said. Suppliers including sand and rail companies say they are hedging their bets by expanding elsewhere.  SHARES FALL ON HIGHER COSTS, LOWER REVENUE The price discount on Permian oil has hurt the share price of shale producers such as Parsley Energy (PE.N), which operates only in the Permian. Slideshow (5 Images)Parsley delivered an eight fold-rise in profits in the second quarter versus a year earlier, and boosted output by 57 percent over the same period. But investors have dumped the stock on concern that plans to increase output by another 5 percent by spending 17 percent more will deliver diminishing returns. Parsley’s shares are down about 8 percent since the company reported results on Aug. 7. Spending plans in 2018 by 53 independent U.S. producers have risen a combined 18 percent over 2017, to $63.2 billion, according to investment firm Cowen & Co.    The U.S. in August produced a record 11 million bpd and continued investment in the Permian should see the country’s total output to hit an average of 11.5 million bpd in 2019.  But rising costs and bottlenecks have already slowed the pace of growth. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates Permian oil production in 2019 will be 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) less than it could be because of transport constraints. Permian output will be 3.9 million bpd next year, Wood Mackenzie estimates, but could have been 4.1 million bpd if more pipeline space were available. “We’ve had a more significant increase in costs this year than we would have assumed,” Timothy Dove, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the largest Permian oil producers, said in August. TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY SHORTAGES Smaller producers without contracts to use pipelines are getting hurt most because they are forced to use trucks and railcars. Shipping oil by truck to Gulf Coast refinery and export hubs costs $15 to $25 a barrel, compared to $8 to $12 a barrel by rail and less than $4 a barrel by pipeline, according to market sources. The shift is leading to traffic jams on highways and rail crossings in far-flung parts of the Permian shale fields. It also means fuel for supply vehicles and fracking equipment can be in short supply locally.  “Truck traffic is unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” said James Walter, co-CEO of Colgate Energy, a Midland-Texas based oil producer, who adds his company has agreements to transport all of its crude and gas production via pipelines. Rail capacity is unlikely to increase because oil producers are reluctant to sign up to long-term contracts to lease rail cars. They would prefer to wait for the new pipelines to be built. Planned pipelines out of the Permian will add about 3 million bpd of oil capacity by late 2020, estimates Wood Mackenzie.  Rail firms are reluctant to buy new oil railcars without long-term contracts.  “We do think it’s a short-term situation,” Union Pacific Executive Vice President Beth Whited said in July. “So we will not invest to support that.”  Sand suppliers have moved quickly to alleviate one supply shortage by opening new operations. Some 15 sand mines have popped up in the Permian in the past year, creating a $1.2 billion industry almost overnight, consultancy Rystad Energy estimates.  These mines sell sand for about $40 a ton, saving producers nearly $90 a ton compared with sand shipped in from other states.  Just as elsewhere in the Permian, however, the increase in activity is inflating costs. Preferred Sands, which has a sand mine in Monahans, Texas, is paying workers there about 30 percent more it does in other markets, said Chief Executive Michael O’Neill, prompting the firm to open its next sand mine in Oklahoma instead.

82,Lawyer of U.S. pastor says to appeal to top Turkish court for his release,"The lawyer of an American Christian pastor on trial on terrorism charges in Turkey said he will appeal to the constitutional court on Wednesday to seek his client’s release. FILE PHOTO: U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson reacts as he arrives at his home after being released from the prison in Izmir, Turkey July 25, 2018. Demiroren News Agency/DHA via REUTERS/File PhotoThe case of Andrew Brunson, whose next regular court hearing is on Oct. 12, has become the most divisive issue in a worsening diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington that has triggered a punishing regime of U.S. sanctions and tariffs against Turkey. “We will appeal tomorrow to the Constitutional Court to lift the house arrest,” lawyer Ismail Cem Halavurt told Reuters on Tuesday. The evangelical pastor is charged with links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric blamed by Turkey for a failed coup attempt in 2016. He has denied the accusation - as has Gulen - and Washington has demanded his immediate release. On Monday, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was determined to fight, within legal and diplomatic frameworks, “this crooked understanding, which imposes sanctions using the excuse of a pastor who is tried due to his dark links with terror organizations.” Halavurt said he did not expect the constitutional court to make a ruling before the Oct. 12 hearing, “but we want to have completed our appeal before (then)”. Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months on terrorism charges and is currently under house arrest. Donald Trump, who counts evangelical Christians among his core supporters, has become a vocal champion of the pastor’s case. The U.S. president believed he and Erdogan had agreed a deal to release him in July as part of a wider agreement, but Ankara has denied this. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters

Trump and Kim have said they want to work toward denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, holding an unprecedented meeting earlier this year in Singapore to discuss the idea. Before they turned the page on decades of public acrimony, the leaders regularly traded threats and insults as North Korea pushed to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the United States. “I was really being tough - and so was he. And we would go back and forth,” Trump told a rally in West Virginia.

84,"Overshadowed by Kavanaugh drama, new Supreme Court term looms","The U.S. Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday in an awkward position, down one justice as the fierce fight unfolds in the Senate over confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to a lifetime job as a justice. FILE PHOTO: The building of the U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File PhotoWith eight justices rather than the usual nine, the court was set to hear arguments in two cases as it opens its nine-month term, according to tradition, on the first Monday of October. Justice Anthony Kennedy retired effective in July, leaving the court ideologically deadlocked with four conservatives and four liberals on the bench awaiting the outcome of the Kavanaugh battle. Trump nominated the conservative federal appeals court judge in July but his confirmation in the Senate remained in doubt over sexual misconduct allegations that he denies. Unlike prior years, when a series of major cases awaited the justices, there are no blockbusters yet on their calendar. Their first argument on Monday is a property rights case involving protected habitat for a warty amphibian known as the dusky gopher frog.  The court’s previous term, which ended in June, included more 5-4 decisions than usual, with conservatives in the majority. These rulings included approving Trump’s travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, prohibiting a type of regulation of anti-abortion clinics, and banning certain public-sector union fees.  “After a term of challenging cases and issues, and an unusually high number of 5-4 decisions, as I see it, we needed our summer break,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joked to an audience last week.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File PhotoFor the current term that runs through next June, the court does have some important cases, though none yet of the magnitude of the biggest from the previous term. One case over whether a state and the federal government can each prosecute a person for the same crime could impact Trump’s willingness to pardon people like Paul Manafort. Trump’s former campaign chairman was convicted in August of financial crimes by a jury in Virginia and then pleaded guilty in September to reduced charges in Washington brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of an investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. Other cases include whether the U.S. attorney general has too much power in determining to whom the federal sex offender registry applies, and whether a state can execute a convicted murderer who, after a series of strokes, forgot the crime.  A number of hot-button issues may still be teed up for the justices this term, including disputes the court did not resolve last term over the constitutionality of an electoral map-drawing practice called partisan gerrymandering and whether people who run businesses can refuse service to gay couples because of religious objections to same-sex marriage.  “The real meat of the coming term is what’s in the pipeline,” Trump administration Solicitor General Noel Francisco said at an event organized by the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers’ group. Major cases making their way up from lower courts include disputes over various abortion restrictions in Republican-led states, whether a federal law against sex discrimination also prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, and Trump’s plan to restrict transgender troops in the military.  Even if only some of those issues come before the justices “we might be talking about this term as one of those blockbuster years that is comparable to what we saw last year,” Francisco said.

85,'Terrorism' ad by indicted Republican roils California election,"When a Democrat with Palestinian-Mexican ancestry who had never before run for office was elected to challenge a Republican incumbent in a staunchly conservative southern California congressional district, few gave him much of a chance. But five-term U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter, who has been criminally charged with misusing campaign funds, is concerned enough about Ammar Campa-Najjar to issue a YouTube ad accusing his Democratic rival of trying “to hide his family’s ties to terrorism.”  It was a reference to his Palestinian grandfather, who was involved in a 1972 plot to kill Israeli athletes at the Olympics and was killed the following year by Israeli commandos. The ad, released on Wednesday, shows Hunter, a former U.S. Marine who followed his father into Congress, dressed in camouflage and saying he approved the message. Campa-Najjar told Reuters on Saturday Hunter’s ad was “racist, xenophobic and rooted in lies.”   He noted he had security clearances to work in the White House and the Labor Department under former President Barack Obama. “If Hunter applied for that clearance under indictment, he would be denied, which is why (House of Representatives Speaker) Paul Ryan stripped him of his seat on the Armed Services Committee, because he would have access to confidential materials. That’s the irony of this,” Campa-Najjar said.  “I think he’s trying to tap into dark emotions and I don’t think people will rise to that,” Campa-Najjar said. Hunter’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoDemocrats need to pick up 23 House of Representatives seats in the Nov. 6 congressional elections if they wish to take a majority and serve as a more effective counter to U.S. President Donald Trump. Republicans can ill afford to lose normally safe seats like Hunter’s, in a district including San Diego, as they look to keep control of that chamber. Polls show Hunter maintaining a comfortable lead over Campa-Najjar, though not as wide as his 27 percentage point margin of victory in 2016. A Monmouth University Poll of 401 voters conducted between Sept. 22 and 26, found 53 percent of likely voters supported Hunter versus 38 percent for Campa-Najjar. The poll had a 5.3 percentage point margin of error. Campa-Najjar’s campaign says its polling shows a much closer race. FAMILY BLAME GAME The 29-year-old Democratic challenger is the son of a Mexican-American mother and a Palestinian father who immigrated from the Middle East. He stresses his Christian faith on the campaign trail and has tried repeatedly to distance himself from his Palestinian grandfather. He responded to Hunter’s ad by pointing to the Republican’s own family troubles: “He knows I’m not responsible for my family’s actions, just like his wife isn’t responsible for his.” Hunter, 41, and his wife pleaded not guilty on Aug. 23 to charges of misusing $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for their children’s private school tuition, lavish travel including a trip to Italy and restaurant meals that cost hundreds of dollars. He has said the charges were politically motivated. Hunter is not the only Republican congressman running for reelection while fighting criminal charges. U.S. Representative Chris Collins is also campaigning in a normally solidly Republican western New York state district while awaiting trial on insider trading charges that he has denied. Both Hunter and Collins were early supporters of Trump, who early this month criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for allowing federal prosecutors to charge Republican candidates in an election year.

87,U.S. Supreme Court declines billionaire appeal in California beach access suit,"The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory to proponents of open access to California’s coastline on Monday, declining the appeal of a billionaire venture capitalist seeking to keep a popular beach locked behind a gate as his exclusive property. FILE PHOTO: A sign and locked gate are shown at the entrance to a private road to Martins Beach, a popular surfing and fishing spot, in Half Moon Bay, California, U.S., March 14, 2013.   REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File PhotoThe high court’s denial leaves intact a state appellate  decision requiring Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla to apply for a California Coastal Commission permit to restrict public entry to Martins Beach in San Mateo County, south of San Francisco. The Supreme Court turns away the vast majority of petitions it receives, with at least four of its nine justices - one seat currently remains vacant - required to agree to hear any particular case. Had the four conservatives on the court voted as a bloc to grant Khosla’s appeal, it would have thrown into question a long-established principle of coastal management in California. The state’s constitution and the California Coastal Act generally guarantee public access to all 1,100 miles of California’s shore from the mean high-tide line of a beach to the water’s edge.  Advocates of open access have insisted that ocean-front property owners seek Coastal Commission approval for any activity limiting the public’s use of a beach. FILE PHOTO: Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla arrives at San Mateo County Superior Court in Redwood City, California, U.S., May 12, 2014. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File PhotoThe coastal protection group Surfrider Foundation said previous landowners going back a century had allowed locals onto Martins Beach for a fee. The group sued after Khosla closed the beach access road behind a locked gate and posted security guards there starting in 2009, refusing to apply for a permit to do so. A state Superior Court judge sided with Surfrider in 2014, finding that Khosla was in violation, and a state appellate court affirmed that ruling three years later. The gate was reopened after that.  Khosla petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case after the state Supreme Court likewise refused to hear it. “We’re grateful the California Coastal Act’s promise that a beach cannot be bought, but instead belongs to the public, has survived a billionaire’s whims, which risked gutting the statute’s protections,” said Eric Buescher, a lawyer representing Surfrider.  A lawyer for Khosla, who owns the beach-front land in question through limited liability corporations, said her client would abide by the outcome and apply for the required permit. But she said he was disappointed. “No owner of private business should be forced to obtain a permit from the government before deciding who it wants to invite onto its property,” attorney Dori Yob Kilmer said, who has framed the dispute as a fight to preserve property rights. The case echoed a similar legal battle over record mogul David Geffen’s efforts to prevent the use of a walkway to Carbon Beach near his Malibu home in Southern California. That dispute was ultimately settled in 2005. Slideshow (2 Images)",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-10-02 00:00:00,Reuters
88,Myanmar's neighbors urge accountability for Rakhine violence,"Southeast Asian foreign ministers have urged Myanmar to give a full mandate to an inquiry commission to hold accountable those responsible for the violence in Rakhine state, Singapore said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows burned down villages once inhabited by the Rohingya seen from the Myanmar military helicopters that carried the U.N. envoys to northern Rakhine state, Myanmar, May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Michelle Nichols/File PhotoThe ministers, who met informally on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly last week, expressed grave concern over the violence, Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told parliament, calling it a “man-made humanitarian disaster”. Over the last year, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies, following a military response to attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents.  A recent U.N. report accused Myanmar’s military of gang rapes and mass killings with “genocidal intent” in Rakhine and called for its commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law. Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report, blaming Rohingya “terrorists” for most accounts of atrocities. “We expressed our grave concern with these alleged acts of violence... This is a man-made humanitarian disaster and something which should not be happening in this day and age,” Balakrishnan said, referring to the meeting of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar. “The foreign ministers urged the Myanmar government that...an independent commission of inquiry...should be given a full mandate to investigate and to hold all those responsible fully accountable.” Singapore chairs ASEAN this year and regional leaders will meet next month in the city-state. Myanmar’s government spokesman, Zaw Htay, did not answer telephone calls on Tuesday. Last month, he said he would no longer speak to the media over the phone but only at a biweekly conference. In July, Myanmar established a commission of inquiry to probe allegations of human rights abuses in Rakhine, which includes two local and two international members from Japan and the Philippines. ASEAN, formed more than half a century ago, has historically struggled with challenges facing the region because it works only by consensus and is reluctant to get involved in any matter deemed to be internal to any of its members. The group’s recent statements on Rakhine have focused on the importance of the repatriation of displaced persons to Myanmar and reconciliation among communities.  But amid the international condemnation, it appears to be taking a firmer stance. Balakrishnan said that if left to “fester”, the situation in Rakhine could lead to the spread of terrorism which would threaten “Southeast Asia and beyond”. “They (the Myanmar government) do need to do the right thing...for all the vulnerable, defenseless and innocent victims,” said Balakrishnan. In a recent interview, Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticized Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi over her handling of the Rohingya crisis, saying, “We don’t really support her anymore.” FILE PHOTO: Rohingya refugees are reflected in rain water along an embankment next to paddy fields after fleeing from Myanmar into Palang Khali, near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh November 2, 2017.

91,German parties agree diesel costs deal - but keep it secret,"Bleary-eyed leaders of Germany’s coalition parties emerged in the small hours of Tuesday morning to say they had agreed on a way of cutting pollution in cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans. But they were tight-lipped on the details of their plan, saying only that ministers would outline the details of a “highly complex” agreement later in the day. Earlier, conservative Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said German carmakers were willing to bear most of the cost of upgrading old diesel cars to reduce air pollution in German cities, but it was not yet clear how drivers would be spared the bill. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Germany’s largest carmaker, has agreed to cover 2,400 euros ($2,780) of the estimated 3,000-euro cost of hardware retrofits on its diesel cars, Scheuer said on a live video chat on Instagram. “Now we have to discuss in the coalition how we handle the gap of 600 euros,” he added. Scheuer has sided with carmakers in calling for incentives for owners of older vehicles to trade them in for newer models. Svenja Schulze, a Social Democrat (SPD), favours hardware retrofits that are unpopular with auto makers. A statement after the talks tersely promised a “concept for clean air in our cities,” while an unexpected pledge to build more wind and solar energy plants hinted at the horse-trading that took place as the three awkward partners struggled to unite around a common position. The past few weeks have seen support slide to all-time lows for both Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party and its Social Democrat (SPD) partners, as her government rowed over everything from diesel to immigration and the threat of far-right violence. The marathon talks, which they promised would become a regular fixture, also yielded agreement on a new law promoting skilled immigration, they said. FILE PHOTO: Cars and trucks are stuck in a traffic jam near Irschenberg, Germany, March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File PhotoThe diesel compromise is likely to feature both trade-in incentives and retrofits. Scheuer said Volkswagen was willing to offer trade-in deals worth up to 8,000 euros, BMW (BMWG.DE) 6,000 euros and Daimler up to 5,000 euros, as well as leasing options. One complaint of German carmakers is that foreign rivals would not be covered by any requirement for retrofits. Volvo of Sweden said it was not working on any such upgrades, but is looking at incentives to encourage customers to trade in diesels for newer, cleaner cars. That option is also being considered by several other foreign carmakers, said Reinhard Zirpel, head of the VDIK car importers’ association. “We have legal, technical and business reservations about hardware upgrades,” he told the Tagesspiegel daily. NO COST TO DRIVERS Scheuer also said his Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats - did not want diesel drivers to face any additional expense. The SPD’s Schulze said a deal must include hardware upgrades and that the entire cost should be borne by the industry: “The car industry caused the problem, and now they have to fix it,” she told SWR Radio in an interview. Volkswagen’s admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceed pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown. At the same time, the German courts have paved the way for city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed European safety levels. The first, in Frankfurt, the financial capital, is due to take effect in February. Volkswagen doubts that hardware retrofits on older diesels are technically feasible and is only willing to foot the bill if it does not have to bear liability for any engine damage that may result, a company source said. That should not be an obstacle to a solution, according to suppliers of catalytic converters - devices that can be installed in cars to convert harmful exhaust pollutants into less harmful gases.

93,Suu Kyi's actions 'regrettable' but she will keep peace prize: Nobel chief,"Some of the actions Aung San Suu Kyi has taken as Myanmar’s civilian leader are “regrettable” but her Nobel Peace Prize will not be withdrawn, the head of the Nobel Foundation told Reuters in an interview in Stockholm on Friday. FILE PHOTO: Myanmar's State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi  is seen while she waits for a meeting with Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang (not pictured) at the Presidential Palace during the World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Hanoi, Vietnam September 13, 2018. REUTERS/Kham/Pool/File PhotoLars Heikensten, speaking days before the awarding of this year’s peace prize, said it made no sense to withdraw awards in reaction to things that happened after they were given, as judges would constantly have to discuss laureates’ merits. U.N. investigators issued a report in August accusing Myanmar’s military of carrying out mass killings of Muslim Rohingya with “genocidal intent” in an operation that drove more than 700,000 refugees across the border to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy and now leads the Myanmar government, was accused in the same report of failing to use her “moral authority” to protect civilians. “We see what she’s been doing in Myanmar has been questioned a lot and we stand for human rights, that’s one of our core values,” Lars Heikensten, the head of the Nobel Foundation, said.  “So of course to the extent that she’s responsible for that, that is very regrettable,” he added. Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer phone calls seeking comment on Monday. He said last month he would no longer speak to the media over the phone, only at a biweekly conference. Myanmar has rejected the U.N. findings as “one-sided”. It says the military action, which followed militant attacks on security forces in August last year, was a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.  Suu Kyi said last month that in hindsight her government could have handled the situation in Rakhine state better, but did not acknowledge any major crimes. “We don’t believe it would make sense to try to withdraw prizes ... it would involve us in constant discussions about the merits about what people are doing afterwards, after they have received the prize,” Heikensten said. “There has always been and there always will be Nobel laureates that are doing things after they’ve been awarded the prize which we do not approve of or which we don’t think are the right things. That we cannot avoid I think,” he added. The Stockholm-based Nobel Foundation oversees the administration of all the Nobel Prizes, which are awarded by different organizations in Sweden and Norway. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Peace Prize, said in August that its rules did not allow awards to be withdrawn.   The laureate of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Oslo.

94,House Republicans weigh subpoena in spat with ex-FBI chief Comey,"U.S. House of Representatives Republicans may subpoena former FBI Director James Comey to force him to testify before a House panel about the agency’s decisions before the 2016 presidential election, a House aide told Reuters on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Former FBI director James Comey arrives at the Irish Film Institute for for a public interview in Dublin, Ireland June 22, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh KilcoyneIn a potential escalation of tensions between rival inquiries into Russian meddling in U.S. politics, House Republicans were prepared to increase pressure on Comey, who has already refused to testify in a closed session. Comey’s attorney David Kelley, in a letter dated Oct. 1 that was sent to the Republican chairmen of two committees, said: “Mr. Comey respectfully declines your request for a private interview. He would, however, welcome the opportunity to testify at a public hearing.” A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters. Representatives Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte chair the House Oversight panel and the Judiciary panel, respectively. Both are probing the FBI’s decisions before the 2016 presidential election; neither is seeking reelection in November. The Republicans’ probe is running parallel to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign. That probe has resulted in indictments or guilty pleas from 32 people. If the Democrats take majority control of the House in the Nov. 6 elections, the two committees’ probes will likely end. Between now and then, it was not immediately clear what Gowdy and Goodlatte hope to accomplish. The House is out of session until Nov. 13. Their probe into the FBI’s handling of Russia’s role in U.S. politics and Hillary Clinton’s emails when she was secretary of state has been criticized by Democrats as seeking to undermine the Mueller probe. Comey, who was fired by Trump, is seen as a key witness into whether Trump tried to obstruct the Mueller probe. Comey has also been criticized by the Justice Department’s inspector general for announcing the FBI’s decision not to propose criminal charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server. Republicans have said Comey’s handling of the Clinton matter shows he is biased against Trump. The inspector general found that while he acted improperly, he did not exhibit bias. Goodlatte recently issued a subpoena to the Justice Department after he alleged it had refused to provide certain documents from the Russia investigation.  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, has since agreed to meet with Republicans in coming weeks, said a person familiar with the matter. ",Politik,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
95,Germany launches charm offensive to redefine U.S. ties,"When Nadia Hassani left Germany after winning a U.S. green card in a lottery 21 years ago, she never dreamed a U.S. president would accuse the program of bringing in terrorists - as Donald Trump did last year. Nadia Hassani, a German-American food writer, is seen in Andreas, Pennsylvania, United States, September 24, 2018. REUTERS/Andrea ShalalNow a cook, gardener and writer, Hassani is a passionate advocate for immigration and diversity in her blog Green Card Gardner greencardgardener.com and has championed the culture of her native Germany in her cookbook Spoonfuls of Germany. This year, she will be taking part in a German-funded charm offensive called Wunderbar Together wunderbartogether.org along with 300 other people and groups to help restore Germany's image in the United States and strengthen ties after criticism of the country by Trump. “The anti-immigration atmosphere undermines the whole reason I came to America. It’s contrary to what America is all about,” said Hassani, who found acceptance in the United States that had been elusive in Germany because of her German-Tunisian heritage. Trump has been at odds with Chancellor Angela Merkel since his election victory in 2016 over issues such as trade, Iran and military spending. He singled out Germany for criticism again during a speech at the U.N. general assembly last week. Germany has mounted similar campaigns before in countries such as China, Mexico and India but those involved with The Year of German-American Friendship (Deutschlandjahr USA) say it is the most ambitious so far. To reach communities beyond the East and West coasts that have typically dominated Berlin’s U.S. outreach efforts, the initiative includes more than 1,000 projects. From pop-up exhibits on the future of work to a cultural WanderbUS that will criss-cross the country to a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus architectural movement, the campaign is meant to shine a positive light on Germany and its culture at time of deep strains between the long-time allies. “We view the Deutschlandjahr as a laboratory to see where  we need to get more engaged, and where we have to do a better job explaining, or perhaps resist more, or perhaps just be stronger,” Emily Haber, Germany’s ambassador to the United States, told reporters in Berlin in August. ‘SPECIAL BOND’ Hassani’s concerns about Trump’s isolationist polices are shared by many Germans, including Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who has been critical of the U.S. president. Maas, who wants to rebalance the transatlantic relationship by strengthening the European Union and partnering with other allies, will kick off the campaign in Washington on Oct. 3, the 28th anniversary of German reunification. “We want to preserve this special bond. To do that we must politically cast a realistic look at the German-American relationship,” Maas said. “If we give Germans and Americans the possibility to be inspired by each other anew, that can help point us as politicians to a new partnership.” Despite their political differences, the countries remain closely linked economically. The United States imports $129 billion of German goods a year, while German firms employ 700,000 people in the United States, making them the fourth largest foreign employer. Some 45 million Americans claim some German heritage - and a third of the 3.4 million Germans living overseas in 2015 were in the United States. More than 10,000 U.S. students study at German universities each year, and the number is growing. Germany and its European partners also depend on the United States for security under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) - a point that has prompted Trump to push Europe to boost military spending. But many German language programs are struggling to survive in the United States and the U.S. military has reduced its presence in Germany since the end of the Cold War. ""Even if the transatlantic community remains the cornerstone of German foreign policy, we cannot view the relationship as self-evident, nor as completely lost,"" wrote Syreta Haggray for the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung www.kas.de/wf/en think-tank.

96,Texas governor says 'bathroom bill' no longer on his agenda,"Texas’ Republican governor said on Friday that legislation limiting transgender people’s access to bathrooms in public schools and government buildings is no longer a priority, signaling a slight change in his stance on a measure seen by critics as discriminatory. FILE PHOTO: Texas Governor Greg Abbott speaks at the annual National Rifle Association (NRA) convention in Dallas, Texas, U.S., May 4, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoGovernor Greg Abbott, who is running for re-election, made a “bathroom bill” one of his priority items in a legislative special session last year. But the measure died in the session after business leaders and civil rights groups fought back, saying it advanced bigotry, would tarnish the state’s image and damage its economy. “It’s not on my agenda,” Abbott said in a debate with Lupe Valdez, the former sheriff of Dallas County who is the Democratic candidate for governor. Abbott did not say if he would sign a bill if one landed on his desk. Valdez, the first openly gay or lesbian major party candidate for governor in the history of Texas, has fought against bathroom bills, saying the legislation addresses a non-existent problem and stirs discrimination against transgender people. “There is a continual fear-mongering, and I don’t believe in laws that start out in fear,” she said in the debate, which is the only debate between the two in a state with an economy bigger than Russia’s. Abbott has a commanding lead in the polls and a campaign war chest that the Dallas Morning News said was about $50 million larger than what Valdez has. The Republican-majority Texas legislature meets once every two years, and the next session is set for 2019.  Adoption of a bathroom bill by Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could have fed momentum in other socially conservative states on the issue, a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. Texas could have lost about $5.6 billion through 2026 if it had enacted such a measure, according to the Texas Association of Business, the state’s leading employer grouping. The measure that advanced the farthest in the 2017 session would have required people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. Momentum for bathroom bills stalled last year nationally when North Carolina partially repealed a similar law in March 2017. The original law prompted boycotts by athletic bodies and businesses that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.

98,Google CEO will testify before U.S. House on bias accusations,"Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee later this year over Republican concerns that the company is biased against conservatives and will also attend a meeting with President Donald Trump, government officials said on Friday. Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks on stage during the annual Google I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California, May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Stephen LamRepublicans want to question Google, the search engine of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), about whether its search algorithms are influenced by human bias. They also want to probe it on issues such as privacy, classification of news and opinion and dealing with countries with human rights violations. Pichai met on Friday with White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, and the pair “discussed a range of issues impacting internet platforms and the economy in general.” Pichai accepted an invitation to attend a White House roundtable with Trump and other internet stakeholders, the White House said. Pichai met with senior Republican lawmakers on Friday to discuss their concerns, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.  McCarthy told reporters after the meeting that the meeting was “very productive” and “frank.” “I think we’ve really shown that there is bias, which is human nature, but you have to have transparency and fairness,” McCarthy said. “As big tech’s business grows, we have not had enough transparency and that has led to an erosion of trust and, perhaps worse, harm to consumers.” Google has repeatedly denied accusations of bias against conservatives. Pichai said in a statement his talks with congressional leaders were constructive and informative and the company remained committed to an “active dialogue with members from both sides of the aisle.” He said he would testify before the House Judiciary Committee “in due course.” Pichai wrote in an internal email last week that suggestions that Google would interfere in search results for political reasons were “absolutely false. We do not bias our products to favor any political agenda.” The CEO had been scheduled to be in Asia this week but canceled the trip to be in Washington. The hearing will take place after the congressional elections in November, McCarthy said. Google came under fire from members of both parties this month for refusing to send a top executive to a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that included Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) executives. Republicans have also raised concerns about Google’s dominance. Earlier this week, the Justice Department met with state attorneys general to focus on the need to protect consumer privacy when big technology companies amass vast troves of data, but came to no immediate conclusions. Asked if Republicans will push to break up Google, McCarthy said: “I don’t see that.”  ",Politik,2018-09-28 00:00:00,Reuters

100,GE's long share price decline claims another casualty,"While John Flannery’s tenure at the helm of General Electric (GE.N) was far shorter than that of his predecessor Jeff Immelt, the two former chiefs have one thing in common: They both presided over a sharp drop in GE shares. FILE PHOTO: General Electric Chief Executive Officer John Flannery presents the company's new strategy and financial targets to investors at a meeting in New York, U.S., November 13, 2017.  REUTERS/Alwyn ScottThe U.S. industrial conglomerate on Monday ousted Flannery as chief executive officer in a surprise move, replacing him with outsider and board member Larry Culp.  In Culp, GE is tapping a former head of another industrial company, Danaher Corp (DHR.N). Culp led Danaher from 2000 to 2014, helping grow an industrial company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while growing earnings. Danaher’s stock soared over that time and prospered while GE’s has struggled. Flannery’s departure comes as he was trying to turn around GE, including through a series of major planned divestitures from the sprawling company.  GE has continued to struggle, including with a recent issue with problems with turbines in its important power unit. GE’s share price suffered under Flannery, falling more than 50 percent since he took over last August. Under Immelt, GE’s shares lost more than a third of their value. GE’s valuation, based on price-to-earnings ratios, also has declined, making the shares far cheaper than those of rival diversified industrial companies. The stock was up nearly 9 percent to $12.29 in Monday trading after the CEO announcement. “Investors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered; however, these problems were not created under his tenure,” CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore said in a note. Indeed, GE’s revenue and profit has declined over the years, in part as GE has pulled back from finance and other businesses. And in recent days the company’s market value slipped below $100 billion after approaching $600 billion about 18 years ago.  ",Top-Nachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
101,Factbox: Details of the new North America free trade deal,"The United States and Canada forged a last-gasp deal on Sunday to salvage a three-country, $1.2 trillion open-trade zone agreement with Mexico that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century. Mexican senator Ricardo Moreal (L) shakes hands with Juan Carlos Baker, Mexico's Undersecretary of Foreign Trade, after he announced a trilateral pact on NAFTA during a news conference at the Senate building in Mexico City, Mexico September 30, 2018. REUTERS/Henry RomeroHere are some of the details in the agreement, which will change its name from NAFTA to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and must be ratified by each country’s legislature before it takes effect: RETAIL The deal would raise Canada’s minimum duty-free shipment threshold, but by less than the United States had wanted, a relief for Canadian retailers facing competition from online stores based in the United States. Canadian residents buying from U.S. retailers will not pay duty on purchases below C$150 and will not pay Canadian sales tax on purchases under C$40, according to the draft text. Mexico had agreed to a single $100 threshold. PHARMACEUTICALS The deal sets a 10-year period of protection for biologic drugs, a class that includes many of the world’s top-selling drugs like rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira and cancer drug Avastin. That means Canadian patients will have to wait longer for cheaper generic alternatives, called biosimilars, to hit the market. Canada previously had an eight-year period of protection for those drugs, according to University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist. He said the longer period would likely result in higher drug prices and higher healthcare costs in Canada. WHEAT GRADING Canada and the United States agreed that wheat imported from the other country would not be treated less favorably than similar domestic wheat. U.S. farmers have complained that their wheat automatically receives the lowest price under Canada’s grading system. DAIRY Canada agreed to provide U.S. dairy farmers access to about 3.5 percent of its approximately $16 billion annual domestic dairy market, Canadian sources said, adding that the Canadian government was prepared to offer compensation to dairy farmers hurt by the deal. Under the agreement, Canada has agreed to eliminate its Class 6 and Class 7 milk categories and associated pricing schedules for skim milk, skim milk proteins and other components and ultrafiltered milk, within six months after the USMCA goes into force.  U.S. farmers said those schedules had effectively pushed them out of the Canadian dairy market.  The agreement will increase U.S. access to Canada’s dairy market beyond Trans-Pacific Partnership levels, a senior Trump administration official said. CHICKEN AND EGGS The United States gets tariff-free access to Canada for 57,000 tonnes of chicken by year six of the deal, growing 1 percent for an additional 10 years. Canada gives the United States access for 10 million dozen eggs and egg-equivalent products in year one, growing 1 percent for 10 more years.  COPYRIGHT Copyright protection will extend for 70 years past an author’s death, in line with current U.S. law. In Canada, copyright generally extends for 50 years past death.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION The deal will preserve a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain in order to protect its lumber industry and other sectors from U.S. anti-dumping tariffs.  No substantial changes appear to have been made to the Chapter 19 trade dispute settlement mechanism, nor the state-to-state dispute settlement. But the agreement limits investor-state dispute settlement to preferential treatment cases and certain sectors dominated by state firms, such as energy and telecoms and infrastructure. Keeping Chapter 19 will not affect Washington’s enforcement of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws, said a U.S. official. AUTOS SIDE LETTER A side letter to the agreement showed that U.S. President Donald Trump preserved the ability to impose threatened 25 percent global tariffs on autos while largely exempting passenger vehicles, pickup trucks and auto parts from Canada and Mexico. If Trump imposes so-called Section 232 auto tariffs on national security grounds, Mexico and Canada would each get a tariff-free passenger vehicle quota of 2.6 million passenger vehicles exported to the United States annually, well above their current export levels. Pickup trucks built in both countries will be exempted entirely. Additionally, Mexico will get an auto parts quota of $108 billion annually, while Canada will get a parts quota of $32.4 billion annually in the event of U.S. auto tariffs. RULES OF ORIGIN FOR AUTOS The deal set a five-year transition period after the agreement enters into force for the regional value content requirement for autos to increase to 75 percent, from the current 62.5 percent. It requires 40 percent of vehicle value to be made in high-wage areas paying $16 an hour, requiring significant automotive production in the United States and Canada. The pact also requires that vehicle manufacturers source at least 70 percent of their steel and aluminum from within the three countries.  ENERGY Reflecting the concerns of Mexico’s incoming government that the agreement would limit the country’s control over its oil resources, the deal states that Mexico has the direct, inalienable and imprescriptible ownership of all hydrocarbons in its subsoil. Despite the strongly worded language, the energy chapter does not prevent foreign oil companies from producing oil in Mexico under a liberalization of the industry passed by the outgoing government.

102,"Canada, buoyed by trade deal, to push U.S. on metal tariffs","Canada, buoyed by a last-minute continental trade deal it sealed with the United States and Mexico, is pressing Washington to remove steel and aluminum tariffs, senior Canadian officials said on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, speaks during a news conference at U.N. headquarters during the General Assembly of the United Nations in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 26, 2018. REUTERS/Amr Alfiky/File PhotoThe agreement, reached on Sunday night, protects Canada’s automotive industry from potentially devastating U.S. tariffs, but includes no assurance that Washington will lift punitive measures it imposed on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum in June. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had made clear he felt the tariffs should be removed before the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement could be signed, but President Donald Trump’s administration has refused to act for now. “Moving forward on eliminating the tariffs on steel and aluminum remains a priority for us, for Mexico, and is something the Americans have indicated they are more than willing to work on,” Trudeau told a news conference. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters in Washington that the United States would be willing to discuss the matter “after we take a few days to catch our breath.” Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said talks on the new pact and the question of tariffs were on separate tracks but added “we have a little bit of wind in our sails and we are very much going to continue to work on this issue”. The United Steelworkers of Canada union called the agreement a “sellout” for steel and aluminum workers.  Business groups largely praised the new agreement, which maintains Canada’s duty-free access to the huge and profitable North American market. The Canadian dollar hit a four-month high against the U.S. greenback, and investors raised bets for as many as four additional interest rate increases from the Bank of Canada by the end of 2019. But Canada also had to agree to offer more access to its highly protected dairy market, which infuriated the influential farming lobby. The province of Quebec, a powerful dairy center, said it was examining its options amid speculation it might sue to block the deal. “We had to make compromises, and some were more difficult than others,” Trudeau said, promising full compensation to dairy farmers who might suffer. “We never believed that it would be easy, and it wasn’t, but today is a good day for Canada.” Trudeau repeatedly made the point that he had managed to preserve the protected domestic market, which some U.S. interest groups said should be scrapped. The concessions are in theory a problem for Trudeau, whose ruling Liberals say they need to pick up seats in Quebec in an election set for October 2019 if he is to retain power. That said, farmers who initially protested when the previous Conservative government agreed to open up the market slightly in deals with the European Union and Pacific nations backed off when Ottawa made clear they would be compensated. Polls show that Trudeau is still personally popular in Quebec and that the Liberals easily would win a federal election if one were held now. ",Politik,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
103,"Cash, cuts and confusion; Trade deal spurs Canadian dairy fears","Canada’s dairy concessions to the United States helped secure a hard-won trade deal, but they spurred talk on Monday of compensation, confusion and curtailed milk production, as a protectionist system faces new threats. U.S. and Canadian negotiators on Sunday reached a tentative trade deal, following an earlier deal between the United States and Mexico, that preserves a trilateral pact between the three North American countries, newly named the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Under the terms covering the dairy sector, Canada surrendered tariff-free access representing about 3.5 percent of the domestic dairy market and agreed to dismantle a pricing system called Class 7 and to restrictions on exports.  The concessions are the latest Canada has made to secure trade pacts that have eroded a system of dairy production quotas and tariffs designed to support prices. The supply-management system has survived, however, thanks to its influence with politicians who fear angering dairy farmers, who live mainly in vote-rich Quebec and Ontario. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said negotiators successfully maintained the supply management system, and the Canadian government will compensate farmers for any deal-related losses. But Dairy Farmers of Canada, the industry’s influential lobby group, tweeted that Trudeau “can’t claim that he protects supply management while subjecting it to a thousand cuts.” “A handful of dollars doesn’t replace the livelihood of dairy farmers,” the group added. Another industry group, the Dairy Processors Association of Canada, estimated losses from the additional market access at C$2 billion over the course of implementation.  Between trade deals with the United States, Europe and Pacific nations, Canadian dairy farmers will cede almost 9 percent of the domestic market to foreign competitors, or about 28 days worth of production volume, said Francois Dumontier, spokesman for a group representing Quebec dairy farmers. Cuts to production quotas are inevitable, said Al Mussell, research lead at Agri-Food Economic Systems. In addition, the deal’s language is vague in places and does not appear to rule out, for example, Canada’s creating a new class to accomplish the same objective as Class 7, he said. Like farmers, Manitoba dairy Bothwell Cheese is queuing for compensation, given “the cost to the industry, which is very significant,” said Wally Smith, Bothwell’s executive vice-president. Even so, investors registered relief that supply management remains in place. Shares of Canadian dairy Saputo Inc (SAP.TO) rose 5 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Under the deal, Canadian exports of milk protein concentrates and skim milk powder - ingredients in cheese and yogurt - cannot exceed 55,000 tonnes in the first year, and 35,000 tonnes in the second, before exporters pay an export tax.

104,"Whereabouts of more than 1,200 Missouri sex offenders unknown: auditor","Local authorities in Missouri do not know the locations of more than 1,200 sex offenders, including nearly 800 who would be classified as the most dangerous, according to a report by the state auditor released on Monday.  Missouri law requires those convicted or found guilty of sexual offenses to register their name, address and other information with local law enforcement, the auditor’s office said. The information is made public through a database and website maintained by the Missouri State Highway Patrol. But because of local officials’ inadequate enforcement of registration requirements, 1,259 registered sex offenders failed to follow law, Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway said.   “Law enforcement can’t track the location of registered sex offenders if sex offender laws are not enforced,” Galloway said in a statement. “This also takes away the ability of Missourians to effectively use the sex offender registry when making decisions to protect themselves and their families.” The state auditor serves as Missouri’s independent watchdog agency.   The audit found that at least 794 of the 1,259 offenders committed offenses including rape, sodomy or child molestation. Failure to comply with registration requirements is a felony, but the audit showed that less than 10 percent of non-compliant offenders had an active arrest warrant. The audit recommended that local authorities check the data in the registry. “The addition of these automated edits will help reduce but may never be able to identify all the ‘human error’ entries,” Lieutenant Colonel Eric Olson, Missouri State Highway Patrol acting superintendent, said in a Sept. 5 letter to Galloway. The letter was included in the auditor’s report. Olson added that accuracy issues will be addressed in future training sessions for staff who register offenders. The registry was implemented in 1995, the report said. Missouri was one of 18 states that initially required lifetime registration for all sex offenders, but the state later provided a process for certain registered offenders to petition for removal from the registry.

105,"'Don't bully us', Britain takes new combative tone to Brexit talks","Britain cannot be bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening the government’s criticism of the European Union for taunting Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks. May’s ministers have come out one by one at their party’s annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to show “respect” in the talks to end Britain’s membership. Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the country’s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years, May faces growing criticism over her proposals not only in her governing party but also in Brussels. Party unity is on British ministers’ minds, and they are encouraging the faithful to direct their anger at the EU rather than at their prime minister, who some euroskeptic Conservatives accuse of leading Britain towards a “Brexit in name only”. But the new strident tone has annoyed many in Brussels, especially when foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the bloc to the Soviet Union, the master of several states in eastern Europe which saw membership of the EU as a measure of their freedom. Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond, have taken a softer tone, pointing out that leaving without a deal could hurt Britain’s economy, the world’s fifth largest. But Raab said he had called on the EU to match the “ambition and pragmatism” Britain had put forward with May’s Chequers proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement with her ministers was hashed out in July. Verwandte ThemenBritain looking at regulatory checks for Brexit Irish border fixBritish seem to think the EU is quitting the UK: JunckerUK Brexit minister says Britain needs a credible response from EU“Unfortunately, that wasn’t on display in Salzburg,” he said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan. “Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation.” “What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our country’s interests,” Raab said, later calling again on the EU to move their position and meet Britain half way. Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit. “NO CHERRIES” A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries” “certainly had an impact”, one official said. With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any future relationship, the possibility of a “no deal Brexit” has increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a worst case scenario. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the discussion in Britain over Brexit was still far removed from reality.    “The world is watching,” said Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the Confederation of British Industry.  Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab delivers his keynote address to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, October 1, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville“Every signal is hugely important in terms of setting the tone. So the more that people can coalesce around some areas of agreement such as an industrial strategy, innovation and skills would be hugely helpful,” he told Reuters. But one source close to the government said there was now a sense that the EU had realized that the tone set in Salzburg was “perhaps a bit off” and, behind the scenes, conversations between the two sides were more constructive. Raab later said the government was open to looking at regulatory checks to try to ease talks on a so-called backstop to prevent a return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - one of the outstanding issues yet to be agreed. Hammond, for one, was keen to pursue a more positive stance. After Brexit, Britain and the EU will still “be neighbors and we are going to have to carry on living with each other,” he told the conference, again backing May’s Chequers plan. “Mr Tusk says it won’t work. But that’s what people said about the light bulb in 1878. Our job is to prove him wrong.” But Hunt’s popular line at conference, that the EU was acting like the Soviet Union, did little to soothe relations, provoking those eastern members of the bloc which only regained full independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. They joined the EU more than a decade later. Lithuania’s EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labor camp and was jailed by the Soviet KGB state security agency. “Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and Soviet Union,” he said. “Anytime. Whatever helps.” Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab delivers his keynote address to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, October 1, 2018.

106,Traders boost Canada interest rate bets as trade deal clips threat to economy,"Investors are raising bets for as many as four additional interest rate increases from the Bank of Canada by the end of 2019 after a deal to save the trilateral NAFTA trade pact reduced uncertainty for Canada’s trade-dependent economy. Economists and strategists say that the deal is a better outcome for Canada than tariffs on its auto exports, that were threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump, and could remove an impediment to investment in the country. It could also prompt the Bank of Canada to reduce the drag to the economy from trade uncertainty that it has built into its projections.  “To me this is a positive outcome,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “Going forward it does remove an impediment to growth, to investment.” The United States and Canada had reached a last-minute deal on Sunday to preserve a single trading zone in North America after serious worries it could fragment under Trump’s trade pressures. The Bank of Canada, which has forecast that trade policy uncertainty will subtract about two-thirds of a percent from gross domestic product by the end of 2020, has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 to leave its policy rate at 1.50 percent.     “October looks as close to a lock (for a rate hike) as a person can reasonably say and it (a trade deal) lowers the hurdles to follow up hikes in 2019 as well,” Kelvin said. The overnight index swaps market has priced in 100 basis points of further tightening before the end of 2019, up from 88 basis points before data on Friday showed stronger-than-expected growth  BOCWATCH in Canada’s economy in July. That amount of tightening could see the central bank outpace the Federal Reserve over the coming year. Money markets expect the Fed, which raised interest rates in September for the third time this year to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, to hike an additional 65 basis points by the end of next year. FEDWATCH The Canadian dollar CAD= strengthened to a four-month high against its U.S. counterpart at $1.2788, or 78.20 U.S. cents, after notching on Friday its biggest gain in four months. At National Bank Financial, Paul-Andre Pinsonnault, a senior fixed income economist said that the Bank of Canada could raise its outlook for growth at the upcoming Monetary Policy Report in October but he cautioned that the central bank will want to see how corporations will react to the trade deal. “It might take some time before we get an uptick in the investment compared to the trend that we have lately,” Pinsonnault said.

108,Husky sees MEG as potential 'hand-in-glove' Canada oil sands merger,"Husky Energy Inc’s (HSE.TO) hostile bid for MEG Energy Corp (MEG.TO) reflects the need for Canadian oil companies to own integrated assets, from production to refineries, to manage the deep price discounts on Canadian crude, Husky’s chief executive said on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Banners for the Canadian company Husky Energy are seen at a sporting event in Lake Louise, Alberta December 1, 2009. REUTERS/Andy Clark    Husky’s cash and stock offer announced on Sunday would combine MEG’s heavy oil production with Husky’s output, pipeline space and refineries, in a deal valued at C$6.4 billion. “This is a real hand-in-glove sort of deal. It just fits together extremely well,” Husky CEO Rob Peabody said on a Monday conference call with analysts. Husky’s bid for highly indebted MEG, which hired a new CEO less than two months ago, is a bet that MEG’s production assets will be lucrative once price differentials return to normal. Even so, some investors own Husky shares for its low exposure to heavy oil differentials and may be disappointed by a bid that increases such risks, analysts said.   The offer comes as Canadian oil producers have struggled with transportation bottlenecks as output has surged, pushing Canadian heavy crude to huge discounts to U.S. light crude. Husky shares fell 7 percent to C$21.19 in Toronto, while MEG stock climbed 38 percent to C$11.08, slightly higher than the offer price. Peabody said Husky is taking the bid directly to MEG shareholders after the company’s leadership refused to discuss it. MEG said on Sunday that its board would consider Husky’s offer when it formally receives it. Husky plans to release its bid circular on Tuesday. The companies are based in Canada, so there are no significant regulatory hurdles, Peabody said. Both have strong ties to Asia, as Husky’s majority investor is Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing. One of MEG’s largest investors is Chinese state-owned oil producer CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK). MEG’s best options are to negotiate for a higher bid or find another suitor, Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick wrote in a note. He added that Canadian producers Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) and Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) are potential bidders. Suncor has no offer on the table for MEG but it considers all opportunities, spokeswoman Sneh Seetal said. Imperial declined to comment. Peabody said Husky will soon meet with MEG shareholders about the deal. MEG shareholders will have the option to receive C$11 in cash or 0.485 of a Husky share for every share held, in a proposal that represents a 37 percent premium to MEG’s closing price on Friday.

112,"In Trump win, Canada, U.S. deal saves NAFTA as trilateral pact","The United States and Canada forged a last-gasp deal on Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a three-country, $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century. In a big victory for his agenda to shake-up an era of global free trade that many associate with the signing of NAFTA in 1994, President Donald Trump coerced Canada and Mexico to accept more restrictive commerce with their main export partner.      Trump’s primary objective in reworking NAFTA was to bring down U.S. trade deficits, a goal he has also pursued with China, by imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on imported goods from the Asian giant.  While the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) avoids tariffs, it will make it harder for global auto makers to build cars cheaply in Mexico and is aimed at bringing more jobs into the United States.  Since talks began more than a year ago, it was clear Canada and Mexico would have to make concessions in the face of Trump’s threats to tear up NAFTA and relief was palpable in both countries on Sunday that the deal was largely intact and had not fractured supply chains between weaker bilateral agreements. “It’s a good day for Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters after a late-night cabinet meeting to discuss the deal, which triggered a jump in global financial markets. In a joint statement, Canada and the United States said it would “result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region”. Verwandte ThemenTrade deal largely spares Canada, Mexico from any Trump auto tariffsNegotiators worked frantically ahead of a midnight ET (0400 GMT) U.S. imposed deadline to settle differences, with both sides making concessions to seal the deal. The United States and Mexico had already clinched a bilateral agreement in August. “It’s a great win for the president and a validation for his strategy in the area of international trade,” a senior administration official told reporters. Trump has approved the deal with Canada, a source familiar with the decision said. U.S. officials intend to sign the agreement with Canada and Mexico at the end of November, after which it would be submitted to the U.S. Congress for approval, a senior U.S. official said. COST FOR CANADA     The deal will preserve a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain to protect its lumber industry and other sectors from U.S. anti-dumping tariffs, U.S. and Canadian officials said. But it came at a cost. Canada has agreed to provide U.S. dairy farmers access to about 3.5 percent of its approximately $16 billion annual domestic dairy market. Although Canadian sources said its government was prepared to offer compensation, dairy farmers reacted angrily. “We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood.” Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada, said in a statement. “This has happened, despite assurances that our government would not sign a bad deal for Canadians.” FILE PHOTO: Dairy cows are seen on a farm in Saint-Valerien-de-Milton, southeast of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, August 30, 2018.  REUTERS/Christinne Muschi/File PhotoThe deal also requires a higher proportion of the parts in a car to be made in areas of North America paying at least $16 an hour, a rule aimed at shifting jobs from Mexico.  Canada and Mexico each agreed to a quota of 2.6 million passenger vehicles exported to the United States in the event that Trump imposes 25 percent global autos tariffs on national security grounds. The quota would allow for significant growth in tariff-free automotive exports from Canada above current production levels of about 2 million units, safeguarding Canadian plants. It is also well above the 1.8 million cars and SUVs Mexico sent north last year. But the deal failed to resolve U.S. tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum exports. The Trump administration had threatened to proceed with a Mexico-only trade pact as U.S. talks with Canada foundered. “It’s a good night for Mexico, and for North America,” Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray said. The news delighted financial markets that had fretted for months about the potential economic damage if NAFTA blew up.  U.S. stock index futures rose, with S&P 500 Index e-mini futures up more than 0.5 percent, suggesting the benchmark index would open near a record on Monday. The Canadian dollar surged to its highest since May against the U.S. dollar, gaining around 0.5 percent.

113,America's image worsens under Trump,"The image of the United States has deteriorated further among its traditional allies after a year in which President Donald Trump ratcheted up his verbal attacks on countries like Canada and Germany, a leading survey showed. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a Medal of Honor ceremony for former U.S. Army medic Ronald J. Shurer awarded ""for conspicuous gallantry"" for actions he took while serving in 2008 in Afghanistan at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 1, 2018. REUTERS/Leah MillisThe survey of 25 nations by the Pew Research Center also showed that respondents from across the globe have less confidence in Trump’s ability to lead than they do in Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has pulled the United States out of international agreements like the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal, cozied up to authoritarian leaders like Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, and criticized his neighbors and NATO allies. In June, after a G7 summit in Canada, Trump refused to sign a joint statement with America’s allies, deriding his host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as “very dishonest and weak”. He has repeatedly attacked Germany for its trade surplus, low defense spending and reliance on Russian gas. Last week, when giving a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Trump drew laughter from world leaders when he claimed to have achieved more in his two years in the White House than almost any other U.S. administration in history.   The survey showed that America’s image, which took a big hit in 2017, Trump’s first year in office, continued to deteriorate in many countries in 2018, particularly in Europe. Just 30 percent of Germans have a favorable view of the United States, down five points from last year and the lowest score in the entire survey after Russia, on 26 percent. Only 38 percent of French and 39 percent of Canadians said they had a positive view of the United States, both down from last year. Mexico inched up slightly to 32 percent. FAITH IN MERKEL HIGHEST The countries with the most positive views of the United States were Israel, the Philippines and South Korea, all at 80 percent or above. Across all countries, the U.S. got positive marks, with 50 percent saying they had a positive view, compared to 43 percent who were negative. Just 7 percent of Spanish, 9 percent of French and 10 percent of Germans said they had confidence in Trump’s leadership. In 20 of the 25 countries surveyed, a majority said they had no confidence in Trump. Across all countries, an average of 27 percent of respondents said they had confidence in Trump. That compared unfavorably to Putin, on 30 percent, and Xi, on 34 percent. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was the only leader in which a majority of those surveyed, 52 percent, expressed confidence. French President Emmanuel Macron was just behind at 46 percent. Despite Trump’s low ratings, 63 percent of respondents said the world was better off with the United States as the leading power, compared to 19 percent who preferred China in that role. Allies took a dim view of the Trump administration’s position on civil liberties, with majorities in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia and Mexico saying the government did not respect the personal freedoms of its people. Reflecting Trump’s “America First” stance, substantial majorities in 19 of the 25 countries surveyed said the United States did not take their interests into account when making international policy.  The survey was conducted between May and August, and based on interviews with over 900 people in each of the surveyed countries. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo adorns a 'Model S' car in the dealership in Berlin, Germany, November 18, 2015. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File PhotoMusk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, bring in two independent directors and have the billionaire step down as board chairman to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that Musk misled investors by tweeting he had financing for a go-private deal.  That settlement must still be approved by a court, and does not end the Justice Department probe disclosed by Tesla into Musk’s tweets or lawsuits by short-sellers and other investors alleging losses and securities law violations.  “The real worry for the company is not the SEC but private actions that follow a settlement like this,” said Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “By paying that size fine, it bolsters investors’” claims over stock market losses, he said.  Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC’s findings as part of the settlement. Neither responded to requests for comment.  Musk settled with the SEC after advisers persuaded him the terms were favorable and a lengthy court fight would not be in the best interest of the company, a person familiar with the deal said. Musk had wanted to personally pay the fine for money-losing Tesla but the SEC rejected that proposal, the person said. Verwandte ThemenTesla shares jump on Model 3 numbers, Musk dealTesla shares plunged around 14 percent on Friday, the day after the SEC charged Musk with misleading investors, and are down 30 percent since his Aug. 7 tweet saying he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share.  Investor claims could result in substantial settlements in cash or equity, Elson said. An equity settlement could end up diluting Musk’s roughly 19 percent stake in Tesla, further reducing his influence on the board.  Still, Tesla shares could stabilize on Monday on investor relief that the penalties were not higher and that the public face of Tesla will remain in the CEO role under added oversight, analysts said.  Tesla is expected to release third-quarter production this week, and investors are watching to see if it hit targets for the Model 3, a high-volume car. Whether Tesla made a profit likely will not be known until it reports financial results for the quarter.  The settlement disclosed by the SEC on Saturday “is a positive outcome for Elon Musk, Tesla and ultimately shareholders,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who added he expects Tesla shares to recoup some of their losses from last week.  An expanded board and new chairman offers hope “a true check on Elon will emerge and there will be greater accountability” over Musk’s statements and business targets, Spak added.  Tesla and Musk ended up accepting harsher penalties than the SEC originally proposed to settle the claims, according to the person familiar with the deal. The SEC initially was ready to accept a fine of a few million dollars and Musk’s removal as chairman for two years, but raised its demands after Musk balked at that offer, the person said.

Tesla fans cheered the signs of a manufacturing jump while business analysts said the company needed to fulfill the spirit of the settlement by appointing a strong independent chair and new directors. The electric carmaker’s shares sank last week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of securities fraud and sought to ban him from company leadership, pointing to a long drawn-out fight that could have undermined Tesla’s operations and ability to raise capital. Instead, under a settlement announced at the weekend, Tesla and Musk will pay $20 million each to the regulator and Musk will step down as chairman but stay as CEO, keeping one of America’s best-known corporate figures in place. In a sign of the manufacturing process improving, Musk in an email to employees on Saturday said the company was “very close to achieving profitability”. He added, “To be certain, we must execute really well tomorrow.” Sunday was the last day of the quarter. Automotive news website Electrek reported here on Monday that Tesla had produced 53,000 of its Model 3 sedans in the third quarter, up from 28,578 in the previous three months and making good on a promise in August it would produce 50,000 to 55,000 of the cars. It produced about 80,000 vehicles overall, the site said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Relief at the settling of the lawsuit drove the biggest one-day gain in Tesla shares in more than five years. “The stock was down so much on Friday because it was unclear if he would remain with the company at all given what the SEC was pushing for,” said Garrett Nelson from CFRA Research.

As part of the settlement with the SEC, Tesla will also appoint an independent chairman and two independent directors, responding to calls on Wall Street to relieve the pressure on Musk and provide more balance in the carmaker’s management. “This is one of the best cases for appointing an independent chair we have seen in a while,” said Courteney Keatinge, research director for proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co. “His behavior hasn’t been great for a while. And I think this kind of behavior has a ripple effect, when there isn’t steady leadership at the top.” Lawyers said the settlement and size of the fine might give more ammunition to short-sellers pursuing separate cases against Musk for manipulating company shares through the Aug. 7 tweet, as well as to a probe by the Justice Department. But several experienced litigators also said that, while the DOJ probe is separate, the SEC’s settlement might mark the end of official action against Tesla and Musk. “The standard of proof for any potential criminal charge is higher than that of a civil case, which the SEC had,” said Jay Dubow, a former branch chief in the SEC’s enforcement division. “It is possible that the DOJ investigation does not result in any criminal charges at least in part because the DOJ could determine that the SEC’s action resolved the matter and that no further governmental action is required.” Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC’s findings under the settlement, which still must be approved by a court.

122,Swedish court finds man at center of Nobel Academy scandal guilty of rape,"A Swedish court on Monday found a man at the center of a scandal that has rocked the academy that awards the Nobel literature prize guilty of rape and sentenced him to two years in jail. The charges against Jean-Claude Arnault prompted some members of the Swedish Academy to quit and forced it to cancel this year’s prize, which would have been announced this month. It is the biggest crisis to hit the Academy since a Swedish king founded it more than 200 years ago.

Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab delivers his keynote address to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, October 1, 2018.

Raab described a media report that had said the government was preparing to back down on customs checks between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland as “overspeculating”.  London has indicated that it may consider options on  regulations on the island of Ireland, noting that there are already some different rules for agriculture and food products between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. But it was not clear whether the government would tolerate such a difference for manufactured goods. Raab told an event on the sidelines of the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham: “Our number one priority is making sure we don’t see a border down the Irish sea that will carve up economically the United Kingdom,” Raab said. “We said we would need to retain a UK-wide customs backstop and on the regulatory side of things, we have been clear that we will, as long as we can carry the communities of Northern Ireland with us, we will be open to be looking at some of the options on regulatory checks.” He also said he welcomed EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s suggestion that technology could help resolve the border issue.

125,Outside attorney walks difficult line at Senate's Kavanaugh hearing,"Rachel Mitchell had a difficult mission as the lawyer hired by Republican senators to question the woman accusing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: test her memory, but treat her respectfully. At a dramatic Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, Mitchell walked that fine line with accuser Christine Blasey Ford, but produced only mixed results and conceded the difficulty of the challenge before her. After more than four hours of questioning Ford in five-minute blocks interspersed by questions from Democratic senators, Mitchell asked Ford in closing remarks if she knew about the best ways to interview trauma victims. “Would you believe me if I told you that there’s no study that says that this setting, in five-minute increments, is the best way to do that?” Mitchell asked. The question drew laughter from Ford and her attorney Michael Bromwich, who interjected: “We’ll stipulate to that.” The exchange underscored the strange format of the first half of the hearing, in which Mitchell, who normally prosecutes alleged perpetrators instead of defending them, quizzed Ford on behalf of Republicans, who sat silent behind her. The panel’s 11 male Republicans hired Mitchell for the task, saying they felt it required an outside expert on sexual assault cases to handle the questioning. Christine Blasey Ford answers to the questions of Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor from Arizona, as she testifies before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2018. Saul Loeb/Pool via REUTERSDemocrats argued before the hearing that the move was an attempt by Republicans to prevent a replay of 1991, when a full panel of male members of the Senate Judiciary Committee was seen by critics as bullying Anita Hill, who had accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.      Jules Epstein, a Temple University law professor, said of Mitchell: “She had a wonderful manner with the witness, and that’s a plus no matter what side you’re on.” But he added that Ford’s testimony, even after Mitchell tried to poke holes in it, seemed credible. As for Mitchell’s questions on behalf of Republicans, he said: “If that’s all they have, it’s not very effective. ... I’m not sure what the strategy is.” Ford, a university professor in California, has accused Kavanaugh, a conservative judge, of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when both were high school students. Her allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh and those of two other women have put in jeopardy his bid for a lifetime Supreme Court job. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. When his turn to testify came, Mitchell asked a few questions. Then Republican senators began asking their own questions. Mitchell is on leave as a special crimes prosecutor in the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office in Phoenix. She said to Ford the best way to “get to memory and truth in terms of interviewing victims of trauma” is for the alleged victim and a trained interviewer to meet one-on-one privately. That was far from what happened in the committee hearing. “You could tell that she, too, was frustrated,” Senator Dick Durbin, a committee Democrat, said of Mitchell.  Some Democrats said they were relieved by Mitchell’s demeanor toward Ford in the hearing.

126,"In #MeToo era, Ford lauded on left and right as honest and brave","Christine Blasey Ford began her testimony in front of a Senate committee by saying she was “terrified,” and at times she looked it.  But by the time she finished detailing her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, Ford was being widely praised as credible and brave. Before the Senate hearing on Thursday, Ford had never appeared on camera, and was only depicted in news media reports with a grainy photo lifted from the internet.  She emerged in the eyes of many American women as a compelling figure in the #MeToo movement that is usually associated less with the names of victims and more with a list of high-profile men accused of misconduct. Thousands of conservatives took to social media to accuse Ford of lying to bring down Kavanaugh, who angrily and tearfully denied her accusations in a day of dramatic, high-stakes testimony from both the accused and the accuser. While Republican senators depicted her testimony as part of a partisan attack orchestrated by Democrats, they — and Kavanaugh — were careful not to attack Ford personally. And outside Congress, even many prominent conservatives were willing to praise Ford. “Dr. Ford comes across as a credible person who has suffered the serious emotional impact of a disturbing incident in her teens,” said Alice Stewart, a conservative strategist who has worked on several Republican presidential campaigns. “This will boil down to the sincere credibility of someone with nothing to gain versus the sincere credibility of someone with everything to lose.” Right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich tweeted, “Ford seems kind. This doesn’t strike me as partisan.” Fox News commentator Chris Wallace called Ford’s testimony “extremely credible” and a “disaster for the Republicans.” Moira Donegan, a writer and prominent voice in the #MeToo movement, said Ford struck a chord among American women. “So many women around the country were watching it together in rooms and texting one another about what they were seeing, identifying with her,” said Donegan said. Still, even many Republicans who believed Ford was honestly recounting what happened to her took the view that it was a case of mistaken identity, believing Kavanaugh’s emotional testimony that was not there and did not attack her. The Republican Party posted online videos of women supporting Kavanaugh throughout Ford’s testimony. Ford, a 51-year-old psychology professor from California, began her appearance by asking for a cup of coffee, her jaw tight with nerves. Her voice cracked at times as she then gave an emotional account of the alleged assault in 1982. When a male senator read Kavanaugh’s denial, Ford appeared to shudder. She appeared to be close to tears at times, but she was firm and dignified throughout. A GoFundMe page to support Ford and pay for her security and legal expenses quickly doubled its fundraising total after it was mentioned during the hearing.  It had already raised the initial target of $150,000 before the hearing and that jumped about $250,000 on Thursday to over $412,000 — from a total of 8,888 people with average donations of about $46. RAINN, a group that provides a support hot line for victims of sexual assault and crimes, said it saw a 147 percent increase  above the normal volume of people reaching out for help. An analysis of social media sentiment conducted by the Ipsos polling firm using an artificial intelligence prototype found that positive sentiment directed toward Ford increased each time she spoke, said pollster Chris Jackson.  “People were responding to her very strongly,” Jackson said, although he also cautioned that it measured posts on Twitter and Facebook and was not a representation of total public sentiment. It was Ford’s telling the committee she now has two front doors at her home — a decision she said she made because of the lasting trauma of the alleged assault — that convinced Kathleen Pierman, 66, who watched the testimony at home.  “She didn’t seem in it for gain,” said Pierman, who lives in the suburbs of Cleveland. She said she found Kavanaugh more convincing than she expected, but said confirming him would be a “huge mistake” because “no one will trust the Supreme Court.”  Three political scientists who specialize in voting behavior and political psychology told Reuters they expected Ford’s testimony to galvanize female Democratic voters to vote in November.

128,U.S. Supreme Court snubs review of defamation suit against Cosby,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Bill Cosby’s bid to avoid a defamation lawsuit brought by a well-known former model who said the comedian sought to destroy her reputation after she publicly accused him of rape. Actor and comedian Bill Cosby is seen in this booking photo released by Montgomery County Correctional Facility, Maryland U.S., September 25, 2018.   Courtesy Montgomery County Correctional Facility/Handout via REUTERS The justices, acting six days after Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison in Pennsylvania for a 2004 sexual assault involving another woman, declined to hear his appeal of a lower court ruling allowing the lawsuit brought by Janice Dickinson in state court in California to proceed. The justices took their action in the Cosby case against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement opposing sexual assault and harassment at the same time that President Donald Trump’s nominee for a vacancy on the high court, Brett Kavanaugh, has denied allegations of his own sexual misconduct. The court’s rejection of the case came on the first day of its new term, which runs through June.  Dickinson gave a national television interview in 2014 accusing Cosby of raping her in 1982. In response, Cosby’s lawyer Martin Singer sent letters to other media outlets warning them not to publish Dickinson’s “defamatory fabrication,” adding that she was “seeking publicity to bolster her fading career.”  A subsequent news release from Cosby’s team said Dickinson was lying. Singer also sent out statements denying similar accusations by other women against Cosby.  Dickinson sued for defamation, claiming the letter and news release aimed to destroy her reputation. Cosby sought to toss those claims, saying Dickinson was trying to stifle his free speech rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. Cosby was sentenced on Sept. 25 for his conviction on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for the drugging and sexual assault of Andrea Constand, a former Temple University administrator, at his Philadelphia home in 2004. More than 50 women in recent years have accused Cosby, who starred in the popular 1980s sitcom “The Cosby Show,” of assault and using drugs to incapacitate them.  A California court of appeals last November rejected Cosby’s argument in the Dickinson dispute, allowing the case to proceed.  Urging the Supreme Court to take the case, Cosby had noted that in two separate cases federal appeals courts held that Singer’s statements responding to accusers were constitutionally protected speech. Cosby said in a court filing that the decision he was challenging could dissuade attorneys from asserting their clients’ innocence.

130,Three of UK PM May's ministers privately 'see argument for' second Brexit vote: lawmaker,"Three British government ministers privately support the idea of holding a second referendum on the final Brexit deal, a former junior minister said on Monday. Conservative lawmaker Phillip Lee, who resigned from the justice ministry in June over the government’s handling of Brexit, told a packed pro-EU event on the sidelines of the party’s annual conference that the ministers had told him so in private conversations.       “I suspect there are significant numbers of colleagues who can see the argument for a second referendum, I know of three ministers who do,” he said in response to a question about how many Conservative lawmakers support a so-called people’s vote. Lee did not identify the three ministers. Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out holding a public vote on any final Brexit deal but the opposition Labour Party increased pressure on her last week by saying it would keep the option of another referendum on the table. With six months to go until Britain is due to leave the European Union, May is yet to reach an exit deal with the bloc, and both Labour and many lawmakers in her own party are threatening to vote against any deal in parliament. Justine Greening, who served as education minister under May until January, said May’s so-called Chequers proposals would not get through parliament, and neither would a Canada-style free trade deal preferred by some Brexit campaigners.  “Parliament is at a stalemate,” Greening told the event. “I think there is a growing body of Conservative MPs who have thought their way through this, as we have, and reached the same logical conclusion that a referendum is the only way to unlock a parliament stalemate.” “It is a question of when they make their views known.” ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

132,FBI probe is the next battle in war over Kavanaugh,"Democratic U.S. senators expressed concern on Sunday over reports the White House was working with Republicans to narrow the scope of an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate members of his Republican Party on Friday and ordered the probe after Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor, detailed her allegations at a Senate hearing that Kavanaugh assaulted her in 1982, when the two were in high school. The stunning reversal capped two weeks of allegations, followed by furious denials, that roiled prospects for Trump’s nominee, a conservative federal appeals court judge once expected to easily become the second Trump nominee to win a lifetime appointment to the top U.S. court. Kavanaugh has denied Ford’s accusation, as well as those of two other women. Separately, the Senate Judiciary Committee made public late on Sunday a previously unreleased interview with Kavanaugh from Sept. 26, before a public hearing with Ford, in which he denied all the allegations against him and committee Democrats declined to ask questions, saying they felt the FBI should investigate the allegations. Republicans, who are trying to retain control of the U.S. Congress in November elections, are seeking to balance their desire for another conservative justice on the court with sensitivity about how they handle sexual misconduct allegations amid the reverberations of the #MeToo movement. It did not take long, however, for the FBI probe to become an object of partisan division. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the White House had defined the parameters of the probe for the FBI and that the investigation would start with interviews with only four people.     Verwandte ThemenFour in 10 believe allegations against Kavanaugh, three in 10 do not: Reuters/Ipsos pollNBC News, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal previously reported that the White House was constraining the investigation, prompting Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to express concern. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the panel’s top Democrat, wrote to White House counsel Donald McGahn and FBI Director Christopher Wray and asked that the committee be provided with a copy of the written directive the White House sent to the FBI, as well as the names of any additional witnesses or evidence if the probe is expanded. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. LIMITING THE PROBE The administration denied it was trying to control the probe, which the Judiciary Committee said on Friday “would be limited to current credible allegations” and wrapped up within a week. “We’re staying out of the way,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told “Fox News Sunday.” However, the administration made clear there would be limits. “It’s not meant to be a fishing expedition,” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Trump vowed on Saturday that the FBI could interview “whoever they deem appropriate.” On Sunday, he criticized Democrats for expressing concerns about the length and scope of the probe. “For them, it will never be enough!” he wrote on Twitter.  FILE PHOTO: Supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., September 27, 2018. Andrew Harnik/Pool via REUTERS/File PhotoThe FBI will question Deborah Ramirez, who said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when both were students at Yale University, the White House official told Reuters.  It will also question Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh who Ford said witnessed the assault, and Leland Keyser and P.J. Smyth, who she said were at the gathering. A third accuser, Julie Swetnick, was not on the initial list of witnesses to be interviewed. Senate Republicans compiled the list of four witnesses and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell shared it with the White House, the official and another source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The New York Times, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that the White House asked the FBI to share its findings after the initial interviews and that Trump and his advisers would then decide whether the accusations should be investigated further. Neither the FBI nor a Judiciary Committee representative would comment on details of the probe. Senator Susan Collins, among a handful of moderates who joined Republican Senator Jeff Flake, said in an email: “I am confident that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews.” Flake was instrumental in forcing the investigation. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said it would not be unlawful for the White House to restrict the investigation’s scope because the FBI is under the executive branch. However, Tobias said FBI agents were usually allowed to act independently and it would be a “clear conflict of interest” for White House officials involved in Kavanaugh’s confirmation process to interfere with the FBI’s investigation.

134,U.S. sues after California governor signs 'net neutrality' law,"The U.S. Justice Department late on Sunday filed suit after California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation to restore open internet protections known as net neutrality in the state after the Trump administration repealed the rules in December 2017. This marked the latest clash between the Trump administration and California, which have sparred over environmental, immigration and other hot-button issues. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Sunday in a statement that “states do not regulate interstate commerce — the federal government does. Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy.” California’s net neutrality law is set to take effect on Jan. 1, but the Justice Department late Sunday in a court filing sought a preliminary injunction to block it from taking effect, warning that internet companies “cannot realistically comply with one set of standards in this area for California and another for the rest of the nation — especially when internet communications frequently cross multiple jurisdictions.” The government said that California sought to “second-guess” the federal government and warned “the effect of this state legislation would be to nullify federal law across the country.” In December, the Federal Communications Commission said in repealing the Obama-era rules that it was preempting states from setting their own rules governing internet access. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said on Sunday the Trump Administration was ignoring “millions of Americans who voiced strong support for net neutrality rules” while  California, which is “home to countless start-ups, tech giants and nearly 40 million consumers - will not allow a handful of power brokers to dictate sources for information or the speed at which websites load.” The Trump administration rules were a win for providers like Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), AT&T Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), but the net neutrality repeal was opposed by internet companies like Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).  Slideshow (2 Images)In March, Brown accused the Trump administration of essentially declaring war on the most populous U.S. state after the Justice Department sued to stop policies that protect illegal immigrants against deportation. Under President Donald Trump, the FCC voted 3-2 in December along party lines to reverse rules that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who led the effort to reverse net neutrality, said in a statement on Sunday that “not only is California’s internet regulation law illegal, it also hurts consumers. The law prohibits many free-data plans, which allow consumers to stream video, music, and the like exempt from any data limits.” Gigi Sohn, a former senior aide to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who ran the agency when the net neutrality rules were adopted, said the California law “is now the model for all future state and federal legislation ... this is what internet users across the political spectrum have said they want by overwhelming majorities.” Jonathan Spalter, who heads USTelecom, an industry trade group, said California’s law will not “help advance the promise and potential of California’s innovation DNA.”  He argued that instead of 50 separate state laws, “we need Congress to step up with a national framework for the whole internet ecosystem and resolve this issue once and for all.” In August, 22 states and a coalition of trade groups representing major tech companies urged a federal appeals court to reinstate the rules. Oral arguments are set for February 1. The U.S. Senate voted in May to reinstate the net neutrality rules, but the measure is unlikely to be approved by the House of Representatives and the White House also opposes it. The FCC in December handed ISPs sweeping new powers to recast how Americans use the internet, as long as they disclose changes. The new rules took effect in June but providers have made no changes in access.     ",Politik,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
135,"At U.N., U.S. at odds with China, Russia over North Korea sanctions","U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned members of the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that they must “set the example” by enforcing sanctions on North Korea as China and Russia suggested the council consider easing the tough measures. China and Russia said the council should reward Pyongyang for the “positive developments” this year with U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un having met in June and Kim pledging to work toward denuclearization. Pompeo chaired a meeting of the 15-member council on the sidelines of the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders after meeting with his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong-ho on Wednesday. Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month. But until Pyongyang gives up its nuclear weapons program, Pompeo said: “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization.”  “The members of the council must set the example on that effort,” Pompeo said. Earlier this month, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Russia of cheating on U.N. sanctions on North Korea. The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Chinese government’s top diplomat Wang Yi noted that there are provisions in Security Council resolutions for the body to modify sanctions if North Korea complies. He said that “given the positive developments” China believed the council “needs to consider invoking in due course this provision to encourage the DPRK and other relevant parties to move denuclearization further ahead,” using North Korea’s official name of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). However, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said later on Thursday that the council resolutions on North Korea do not provide for any exceptions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov backed his Chinese colleague. Lavrov said that “any negotiation is a two-way street. Steps by the DPRK towards gradual disarmament should be followed by the easing of sanctions.” He was also critical of several U.S. attempts to tighten U.N. sanctions on North Korea in recent months.  In July, Russia and China delayed a U.S. push for the council’s sanctions committee to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to North Korea, asking for more detail on a U.S. accusation that Pyongyang breached sanctions, diplomats said. Then last month, Russia and China objected to a U.S. proposal to add a Russian bank, a Moscow-based North Korean banker and two other entities to a U.N. Security Council blacklist, diplomats said. “Further increase of sanctions goes beyond cutting off financing of banned missile and nuclear programs, and is in fact a threat to North Korean citizens and would bring extreme socio-economic and humanitarian suffering,” Lavrov said.  Lavrov said the Security Council should send a clear signal in support of the positive momentum on the Korean Peninsula.  “This could be done, for example, by adopting a relevant resolution and we want to prepare a draft of such a resolution and propose it to the Security Council,” he said. Sweden’s Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom, speaking at the same meeting, agreed that the council should recognize that “recent progress has shown that is possible to diffuse tensions through dialogue and cooperation.” Diplomats have said the United States did not want the Security Council to issue a statement on the developments.

136,"With opinion split, tariffs are a tough sell in America's Rust Belt: Reuters/Ipsos poll","Politicians in America’s Rust Belt will likely struggle to capitalize on U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war in November’s congressional elections, with a September poll showing voters in the region are cool on the effect of tariffs. Water flows out as a steel slab is cooled at a steel mill in Farrell, Pennsylvania, U.S., March 9, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk A Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics Poll found that a plurality of voters in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - states in America’s industrial heartland that backed Trump in the 2016 presidential election - thought tariffs were not good for themselves or their families. Support for tariffs among likely voters - people who have been identified as most likely to take part in the upcoming election - varied from 33 percent in Pennsylvania to 38 percent in Michigan. In all states, more were negative on tariffs, varying from 44 percent in Indiana to 50 percent in Wisconsin.  “Trade and tariffs aren’t this powerfully positive issue for the President and Republicans; if anything they are viewed as counterproductive to the people and places that elected Trump,” said John Austin, Michigan-based Nonresident Brookings Institute Senior Fellow, based on the survey and anecdotal evidence. Trade and tariffs have become a thorny issue for congressional candidates as they seek to win votes in the mid-term elections. On the presidential campaign trail, many Rust Belt voters cheered Trump’s criticism of international trade agreements as being bad for the United States. However, new deals have proven tough to strike. Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have allowed U.S. producers to raise their prices, but hiked costs for manufacturers of cars and other goods. U.S. exporters are also facing retaliatory tariffs from China and others. While support for tariffs was more pronounced among Republicans than Democrats, the issue is not turning into an automatic slam-dunk for Republicans. Among Republican-voting respondents in the poll, only a little over half in some Rust Belt states thought tariffs were good for their families - 53 percent in Indiana and 51 percent in Pennsylvania. It was slightly more in Ohio at 57 percent. Approval was higher in Michigan at 59 percent and Wisconsin, at 60 percent. A poll released on Wednesday showed a majority of likely voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana disapprove of Trump. Indiana Republican Mike Braun, running against Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly, was quoted in the Indianapolis Star in February as saying that tariffs were a ""mistake"" because they provoke retaliation. Braun's campaign did not respond to a request for comment about his views on tariffs. His opponent, a pro-union Democrat who has in the past favored trade protection measures, has said he is concerned about the president's actions. Likely-voter poll respondents were more inclined to think that international trade created jobs rather than caused job losses. Yet a majority of respondents in each state also thought international trade hurts average Americans because it keeps wages down due to the cheaper cost of foreign labor. Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said tariffs and trade can be a misunderstood topic and it was “entirely plausible that trade is not a big part of the midterm elections.” “I spend most of my time thinking about international trade but most people don’t,” Bown said. Michigan and Indiana have particularly high international trade exposure, according to Moody’s credit agency, which said Michigan had international trade account for 38 percent of its gross domestic product, while Indiana had 24 percent. The state polls were conducted online, in English, from Sept. 12 to Sept. 21. They surveyed between 1,074 and 1,181 likely voters in each of five states and weighted the responses according to the latest government population estimates.

137,Trump accuses China of 2018 election meddling; Beijing rejects charge,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, saying Beijing did not want his Republican Party to do well because of his pugnacious stance on trade. “China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November. Against my administration,”  Trump told a U.N. Security Council meeting whose ostensible subject was nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Chairing the Council for the first time, Trump made no reference to suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and provided no evidence for his allegation about China, which Beijing immediately rejected during the same meeting. “We did not and will not interfere in any country’s domestic affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China,” the Chinese government’s top diplomat Wang Yi told the Council. The United States and China are embroiled in a trade war, sparked by Trump’s accusations that China has long sought to steal U.S. intellectual property, limit access to its own market and unfairly subsidize state-owned companies. Later on Wednesday, Trump referred to a Chinese government-run media company’s four-page supplement in the Sunday Des Moines Register promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade. The practice of foreign governments buying space in U.S. newspapers to promote trade is common and differs from a clandestine operation run by a national intelligence agency. Verwandte ThemenChina says does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs“China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news,” Trump said in a Twitter post. In a Des Moines Register article about the advertising supplement, Carol Hunter, executive editor of the newspaper, said the placement was not surprising. “It’s not surprising that China Daily sought to place advertising with the Des Moines Register, because the Register is Iowa’s largest news organization and Iowa farmers are disproportionately affected by China’s tariffs,” Hunter said. A senior Trump administration official said China uses political, economic, commercial, military and information tools to influence U.S. public opinion and promote the interests of the Chinese government and Communist Party. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence plans to make a speech next week detailing the allegations, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, saying the U.S. government was working to declassify further information on the matter. During an evening news conference, Trump described Chinese President Xi Jinping as a friend, prompting a reporter to ask how that could be the case given the allegations of meddling. “Maybe he’s not any more, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump replied.  U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he chairs a meeting of the United Nations Security Council held during the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018. REUTERS/Eduardo MunozIRAN: U.S. ‘ABUSED’ COUNCIL SESSION Trump also used the Security Council session to defend the U.S. withdrawal in May from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, hint at progress in U.S. efforts to curb North Korea’s nuclear program, and to criticize Iran and Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s war, now in its eighth year. “The Syrian regime’s butchery is enabled by Russia and Iran,” Trump said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded in a Twitter post, saying the United States had “abused” the Council and is “further isolated.” Trump’s allegation of Chinese election meddling came as a surprise during a formal meeting around the Security Council’s horseshoe table that was expected to concentrate on the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. “They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade and we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level. We don’t want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election,” said Trump, who is attending the U.N.’s annual gathering of world leaders. Trump himself is not up for re-election until 2020 but November’s voting will decide whether his Republican Party can keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Some opinion polls show that the Democratic Party could make a strong showing, notably in the House. In the latest salvo in the trade dispute, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on $60 billion worth of U.S. products kicked in on Monday, unnerving global financial markets. During his roughly 10-minute speech, Trump made no reference to U.S. allegations against Russia concerning the election that brought him to power. Slideshow (2 Images)Speaking later to reporters, Trump said: “They (China) are trying to meddle in our elections. And we’re not going to let that happen, just as we’re not going to let that happen with Russia.” Trump’s presidency has been dogged by the Russian issue, which led to an investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, which Trump rejects. Moscow denies interfering. ",Politik,2018-09-26 00:00:00,Reuters

140,French watchdog says EU market rules need overhaul after Brexit,"Britain’s departure from the European Union next March will force a full review of the bloc’s sweeping new rules for markets, including tougher market-access conditions for foreign trading platforms, a top French regulator said on Monday. Robert Ophele, chairman of France’s AMF markets watchdog, said Brexit will force the EU to undertake a complete review of the so-called MiFID II rules. “I don’t think there is a need for a major overhaul of MiFID, but clearly there are some quick fixes, some elements that should be adapted,” Ophele told a conference held by AFME, a banking industry body. The MiFID rules, which run to hundreds of pages, were only introduced in January, a year late, because of the complexity and the cost for trading firms, banks and even regulators to implement them. France is actively courting banks based in Britain that are opening EU hubs to avoid Brexit disruption, hoping they will base their trading operations in Paris. Ophele said legislative fixes were needed to stop market participants circumventing the rules and to improve the quality of transaction data. “MiFID II may be a complex piece of law, but that does not mean we should shy away from re-opening it and fixing deficiencies where evidence may show that we have gone too far or have generated unintended consequences,” Ophele told an industry event in London. MiFID II has introduced caps on trading shares in the “dark” or away from transparent platforms like stock exchanges, but Brexit will mean that much of that trading will no longer be in the bloc. “In the light of this, it makes sense to question whether MiFID II’s quantitative calibrations will be relevant tomorrow when the UK is no longer in the EU,” Ophele said. TOUGHER EQUIVALENCE Waivers from MiFID rules affecting commodities trading will also need to be revisited given that nearly all metals, oil and coal derivatives are traded in London, Ophele said. MiFID allows trading firms based outside the EU to serve customers in the bloc if their home rules are aligned or “equivalent” to the bloc’s own regulation. Ophele said that foreign firms should be made to comply with more of MiFID’s reporting and trading obligations for derivatives and shares in order to qualify, dashing UK hopes of an easing of the equivalence regime. Separately on Monday, the EU’s securities watchdog ESMA published a letter dated Sept. 26 to the European Commission that also called for tougher application of MiFID to non-EU firms that serve investors in the bloc. So-called reverse solicitation, or where a non-EU firm is allowed to serve an EU customer that had initiated the initial contact, should also be reviewed, ESMA said.  MiFID “does not ensure a consistent and convergent level of protection to investors interacting with third country firms”, ESMA added. Brussels will only decide if a foreign firm is equivalent if it has cooperation agreements with its regulator. Ophele said firms should assume there will be such an agreement between supervisors in the EU and Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

REUTERS/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus/File PhotoThey are now part of “How We Mourned,” a somber exhibit at the Clark County Museum that helps mark the first anniversary of the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting spree that killed 58 people and wounded over 800 at an outdoor festival on the Las Vegas Strip. Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired real estate investor, poured gunfire from his 32nd-floor hotel suite into a crowd of 20,000 people attending the Route 91 Harvest festival last Oct. 1, then killed himself before police stormed his room. In August, authorities closed their investigation without an explanation for what motivated Paddock. After the carnage, scores of Las Vegas residents and visitors placed an eclectic array of offerings in various areas of the gambling mecca, including the traffic island that’s home to the iconic “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign.  Museum Administrator Mark Hall-Patton said only a relatively small portion of the more than 15,000 items collected - approximately 3,000 - were displayed in the exhibit.  With 25 volunteers spending 7,000 hours sorting, photographing and cataloguing what Hall-Patton called trailerloads of items, the artifacts will eventually be placed in storage and made available for study. “Anything that could be saved, we saved,” Hall-Patton said. “We’re not done yet.”  The exhibit is on display until Feb. 28. The items include everything from stuffed animals, painted rocks and artificial flower bouquets to T-shirts, cowboy hats, whiskey bottles and rosaries.  Schools from as far away as Canada sent letters expressing sympathy. A group from Hawaii brought a peace lei hundreds of yards long, with 58 white crosses. Contributions have come in from around the world. “This is an international exhibit,” Hall-Patton said, noting tourists “flew into town from overseas” just to present their offerings and pay their respects.” Many of the items, including a large hand-painted “Vegas Strong” banner signed by hundreds of well-wishers, were created without a thought given to preservation for future generations. “One of the challenges we have is, how are we going to preserve that?” he said. “They were looked at as a short-term statement of care.” Sorting through the vast assortment of items from such an emotional time in the community’s history was at times difficult, he said. “It affects everybody,” Hall-Patton said. “You walk away sometimes.

144,New Fiat Chrysler boss picks team to tackle industry in flux,"Fiat Chrysler’s (FCHA.MI) new boss unveiled his management team on Monday, seeking to revive the automaker in Europe, forge ahead in North America and keep the group in contention in the industry’s race to develop self-driving and electric cars.  Mike Manley took over in July after long-time chief Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died after succumbing to complications from surgery. British-born Manley has since pledged to carry through a strategy Marchionne outlined in June to keep FCA “strong and independent”. “The next five years will continue to be extremely challenging for our industry, with tougher regulations, intense competition and probably slower industry growth around the world,” Manley said in a letter to employees on Monday.  “Nevertheless, with a laser focus on execution and a continued flexibility that allows us to adjust as circumstances change  ... we have a clear line of sight to achieving our five-year ambitions.”     Manley appointed Pietro Gorlier, thus far head of FCA’s components business, as FCA’s next European chief to tackle a region where profitability is below that of peers, many workers are stuck in furloughs and various plants run at below capacity. Gorlier succeeds Alfredo Altavilla who left after Manley’s appointment. At Magneti Marelli, the parts unit that FCA may either spin off or sell, Gorlier will be succeeded by the parts maker’s lighting division head Ermanno Ferrari. Japan’s Calsonic Kansei has been in talks with FCA about buying the unit, sources familiar with the matter have said, but no binding agreement has been reached and the deal could still fall apart.  Choosing an Italian as head of Europe might soothe some fears in Italy that FCA could weaken its link to Fiat’s roots.  In his last strategy unveiled in June, Marchionne vowed to convert Italian plants to churn out Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Maseratis instead of less profitable mass-market vehicles to preserve jobs and boost margins. Europe will also become a big part of the company’s electrification drive. FCA will copy in Europe what worked in the United States, where it retooled plants to build pricier SUVs and trucks in a move since emulated by bigger rivals Ford (F.N) and GM (GM.N). JEEP Manley also named new managers at Jeep and RAM, the two brands which have been driving profits in recent years.  Tim Kuniskis was named head of Jeep North America, while Reid Bigland was named head of trucks brand RAM.  Manley, who looked after Jeep and RAM before becoming CEO, will continue to keep an eye on Jeep, as no global head for FCA’s most lucrative brand was named. FCA shares were up 3.4 percent by 1407 GMT. With Kuniski’s appointment “we have all of our regions covered by Jeep brand executives who oversee day-to-day operations and Jeep product strategy in each region”, a spokesman said, adding Manley and the group executive council would ensure regional and brand objectives were in line with its business plan. FCA said in June it would ramp up production of SUVs and invest billion of euros in electric and hybrid cars in a bid to double operating profit by 2022. Marchionne said at the time that sales at Jeep, which will launch nine new products and enter three new segments, could double by then from the 1.4 million vehicles sold in 2017. Kuniskis will also remain in charge of Alfa Romeo, while Harald Wester, current chief technology officer, will take on an additional role of leading luxury brand Maserati.  Manley and his team have big shoes to fill: Marchionne achieved what many thought impossible, most notably his huge gamble just over a decade ago when he set in motion the marriage between the then-ailing Fiat with bankrupt U.S. rival Chrysler.  It is now the world’s seventh-largest carmaker and is debt-free, but not without challenges ahead.  FCA cut its full-year profit outlook in July, blaming a weaker-than-expected performance in China, a market that represents one of the new CEO’s immediate headaches.

146,"Desperate Indonesians flee quake zone, with scale of disaster unclear","Indonesia scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp. The confirmed death toll of 844 was certain to rise as rescuers reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet). Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Hundreds more were feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages. Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, where communication had been cut off. The four districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. One woman was recovered alive from ruins overnight in the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, where about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said. “We don’t know how many victims could be buried there, it’s estimated hundreds,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where workers were preparing a mass grave to bury the dead as soon as they were identified. Verwandte ThemenTsunami warning failed on 'last mile': German geosciences centerChaotic scenes in quake-hit Indonesia as bodies lie unclaimedIndonesia says it needs more heavy equipment, rescuers in quake zoneNearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster was not known with authorities bracing for the toll to climb - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored. Aid worker Lian Gogali, who had reached Donggala district by motorcycle, said hundreds of people facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked. “It’s devastating,” she told Reuters by text. Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said a church in an area of Sigi, south of Palu, had been engulfed in mud and debris. Officials said the area suffered liquefaction, when the shock of the quake temporarily destabilizes the soil. “My volunteers found 34 bodies ... children who had been doing a bible camp,” Arriani said. Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation’s five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region. Pictures showed expanses of splintered wood, washed-up cars and trees mashed together, with rooftops and roads split asunder. Access to many areas is being hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges. AIRPORT CHAOS A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for miles. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading toward the city while residents streamed out. The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesia’s logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice. The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for the recovery.

Chief security minister Wiranto said more than 2,800 troops had been deployed and plans were in place to send in a further 2,000 police. The government would accept offers of help from 18 countries and it had also commandeered 20 excavators from mines and plantations to help with a shortage of equipment to dig through wreckage and clear blocked roads, he said. Nearly 60,000 people were displaced, many terrified by powerful aftershocks, and they needed tents, water and sanitary facilities, while the power utility was working to restore electricity, he said. Commercial flights have yet to resume but military aircraft were taking people out of Palu. About 3,000 people thronged the small airport hoping to get out and officers struggled to keep order. “I’d get a plane anywhere. I’ve been waiting for two days. Haven’t eaten, barely had a drink,” said 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid. Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Palu sits astride the Palu-Koro fault, which runs north-south along the edge of Palu Bay. Geologists estimate segments of the fault have a slip that is among the highest in Indonesia, at 4 cm (1.6 inches) a year, exposing the area to a higher risk of quakes. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after the 2004 disaster appear to have failed. Disaster agency spokesman Nugroho told reporters on Sunday none of Indonesia’s tsunami buoys, one device used to detect waves, had been operating since 2012. He blamed a lack of funds. Slideshow (24 Images)The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. However, officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force.   ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
147,Tsunami warning failed on 'last mile': German geosciences center,"Tsunami warnings to the local population of quake-hit Sulawesi island failed on the “last mile”, causing many to be surprised by waves as high as six meters (20 feet), according to a German research center that developed a warning system used by Indonesia. People search through debris in a residential area following an earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Antara Foto/Darwin Fatir/via REUTERSQuestions have arisen over why warning systems appeared to have failed after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Indonesia on Friday. The confirmed death toll from the quake and subsequent tsunami had reached 844 by Monday and was expected to rise further. “The problem was the communication between local authorities and people, for example on the beach, such as in Sulawesi,” Joern Lauterjung, Director Geoservices at GFZ, told Reuters TV. Germany provided a warning system developed by GFZ to Indonesia after a devastating tsunami killed 226,000 people in 2004. Lauterjung said that system worked as planned, predicting waves up to three meters northwest of Sulawesi. “If you look at the entire warning chain from the creation of a warning signal up to the last mile, as we call it, up to the local population in danger, there was a problem there,” he said. “For example, it appears sirens did not work and there were no warnings via loudspeaker vans from police to the local population,” he added.

150,Who is the Arizona prosecutor chosen to question Kavanaugh and his accuser?,"Hoping to salvage the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and cement a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation, Republicans have chosen a woman who prosecuted sex crimes in Arizona to question President Donald Trump’s nominee about sexual assault allegations.     Rachel Mitchell is seen in this Maricopa County Attorney's Office photo from Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., released on September 26, 2018.  Courtesy Maricopa County Attorney's Office/Handout via REUTERS  In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, Rachel Mitchell, and not the Republican committee members, all of whom are male, will question Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexually assaulting her in high school. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said they chose Mitchell for her experience and objectivity. She is on leave as chief of the special victims division in the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office in Phoenix, Arizona.      As the special victims division head, she supervises prosecutors handling cases of sexual assault, child molestation, child prostitution and computer-related sexual offenses. She had served as a prosecutor since 1993.  Her office said she was not available for interviews on Wednesday. Mitchell was drawn to prosecuting sex crimes after assisting a senior lawyer in a case against a youth choir director, she told a magazine affiliated with a Christian organization in 2012. “It struck me how innocent and vulnerable the victims of these cases really were,” she said.  One of Mitchell’s notable victories came in 2005 when she secured a guilty verdict against Catholic priest Paul LeBrun for sexually abusing boys in Arizona in the 1980s and 1990s. He was sentenced to 111 years in prison.  In 2011, Mitchell was criticized over what the Phoenix New Times newspaper called a “slap-on-the-wrist” plea deal for an elder in the Jehovah’s Witness church who had abused a Phoenix teenager. A statement from Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, her boss, said Mitchell has a “caring heart” for victims and has lectured around the country on sexual assault investigations and prosecutions.  “The American people can be confident that Rachel Mitchell’s experience as a conscientious prosecutor, trained to seek justice, protect victims, and pursue truth will assist the Senate Judiciary Committee in performing its important task,” he said.  Blasey Ford’s attorneys have objected to the use of an outside counsel at Thursday’s hearing, saying Ford has repeatedly requested that senators handle the questioning.  “This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate,” Ford lawyer Michael Bromwich said in a letter sent to Grassley on Monday and seen by Reuters.  Ford, a university professor in California, has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when both were students at a private high school in Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington. Her allegations, along with those of another woman, have put Kavanaugh’s lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court in jeopardy. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.  Another woman came forward on Wednesday with yet more claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, further inflaming an already contentious confirmation process.

153,Santander says Brexit uncertainty may have 'significant' impact on results,"Britain’s exit from the European Union will likely trigger a period of high uncertainty that may significantly impact Banco Santander’s business, the Spanish lender said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. FILE PHOTO: A Santander logo is seen in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, September 6, 2017.  REUTERS/Sergio Moraes - RC13E44F74D0/File PhotoThe document, which details Brexit’s potential impact on Santander’s UK operations including its operating results and its ability to hire and retain staff, was the most specific statement to date from the euro zone’s largest bank by market value. “There remains significant uncertainty as to the respective legal and regulatory environments in which we and our subsidiaries will operate when the UK is no longer a member of the EU,” the bank said in a filing on Friday to the SEC. “This uncertainty, and any actions taken as a result of this uncertainty, as well as new or amended rules, may have a significant impact on our operating results, financial condition and prospects,” it said as part of risk assessment. In Britain, Santander’s net profit fell 8.8 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, partly due to ongoing competitive pressure on income and costs related to regulation and digital projects. Banco Santander also said in its filing it was finalizing the implementation of restructuring and strategic initiatives, such as the ring-fencing of retail banking activities in the UK, its third-largest market. The bank has already transferred 22.9 billion pounds ($29.9 billion) of assets and 20.7 billion pounds of liabilities to its Madrid-based parent group in a move to comply with new rules that come into force next year. Banks operating in Britain must separate deposit-taking operations from riskier investment banking activities before January 2019. Personal and small business banking services will have to be provided by a ‘ring-fenced bank’. Britain’s looming exit from the EU and political uncertainty in Brazil are expected to test the management skills of Santander’s new chief executive Andrea Orcel [nL8N1WC37J]. So far this year, Santander has lost around 20 percent of its value as lenders face pressure from low interest rates, especially in Spain, its second-biggest market, while trying to shift from traditional commercial banking towards more digital-oriented lending to compete with fintech startups.

155,"As Chinese influence grows, Japanese warship visits Sri Lanka","Japan’s largest warship, the Kaga helicopter carrier, sailed into Sri Lanka’s Colombo harbor this weekend, marking Tokyo’s highest profile salvo in a diplomatic battle with China for influence along the region’s vital commercial sea lanes.     Japanese destroyer Inazuma is seen behind one of its ship inspection teams on a small patrol boat in the Indian Ocean, September 27, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon  Japan has long provided low-interest loans and aid to Sri Lanka, helping it transform Colombo into a major trans-shipment port tapping the artery of global trade just south of the island that links Europe and the Middle East with Asia.  Beijing has, however, emerged as a powerful rival across South Asia and beyond as it implements its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.  Both China and Japan are also flexing their military muscles further from home. China’s navy is increasingly venturing beyond the Western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean as it targets a world-class blue water fleet by 2050, while Japan’s military diplomacy is flourishing under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.          “Japan’s government is promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and this deployment in the Asia Pacific is a component of that strategy,” Rear Admiral Tatsuya Fukuda, the commander of the Kaga and its destroyer escort, said in his cabin as the carrier steamed for Colombo through the Indian Ocean. “Maritime security and stability is of critical importance” to an island nation like Japan, he added. On its way to Sri Lanka, the 248 meter (814 ft) ship was shadowed by Chinese frigates in the South China Sea and carried out naval drills in the Philippines and Indonesia. It also drilled with a British Navy frigate before docking in Colombo on Sunday with 500 sailors and four submarine hunting helicopters aboard. As part of the goodwill visit, the Kaga’s crew also brought packets of colorful origami paper, crafting flowers for local children who came to tour the ship soon after it docked.  TUSSLE WITH CHINA The visit was intended to reassure Sri Lanka of Japan’s willingness and capability to dispatch its most powerful military assets to a region where China is growing in influence. “Sri Lanka, as a hub in the Indian Ocean, and upholding its commitment to a free and open Indian Ocean, welcomes naval vessels from all our partner nations, to interact with Sri Lanka’s Navy,” said Sri Lankan foreign ministry spokeswoman Mahishini Colonne. “Several navy vessels from our partner countries have visited Sri Lanka this year already and the ship from Japan, a close bilateral partner, is welcomed in the same spirit.”   Sri Lanka recently agreed to cede control of the new $1.5 billion Hambantota port on its southern coast to China Merchants Port Holdings in a bid to ease the debt burden it has accumulated with Beijing. China’s Foreign Ministry denies it engages in unsustainable or unwanted lending and says the port project will help Sri Lanka become an Indian Ocean logistics hub. Tokyo’s diplomatic counter-offensive has included a visit in January by Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Kono, the first by a top Japanese diplomat in 16 years. In August, Japan’s defense minister also went to Sri Lanka and visited Hambantota. “Sri Lanka is a key country within the region and a core part of Japan’s open and free Indo-Pacific strategy. A monopoly by any country at a Sri Lankan port would run counter to that,” a foreign ministry official told Reuters, asking not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media. In March, Sri Lanka’s President Maithripala Sirisena visited Tokyo for talks with Abe, who despite being constrained by a constitution that forbids the use of force overseas, has sought a greater role for his military in the region.  That has worried China, and could be an issue as Abe prepares to travel to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.  “The message to China is that Japan with India and the United States and of course Sri Lanka has the capacity to engage militarily,” said Nozomu Yoshitomi, a professor at Nihon University in Tokyo, and a former Ground Self Defence Force major general who advised the Japanese cabinet.     OPPOSITION AT HOME Such naval forays are a recent change that for some veteran sailors on the Kaga was unexpected.  “When I joined, we would sail out for the day and train from morning till night. I never imagined that we would be deployed on actual missions like this,” said Command Master Chief, Yasuhara Tohno, a 35 year navy veteran. The Kaga is half-way through a two-month deployment that will see it visit India next. In the last five years, Japanese naval vessels have stopped in Sri Lanka 50 times, according to Fukuda.  But the Kaga’s new role as a big stick of Japanese diplomacy is for some influential military experts in Japan foolhardy because it means deploying ships away from where they are needed more. “I am strongly against it,” said Yoji Koda, a retired admiral who is now a fellow at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard. “Our navy was tasked to kill submarines in the Western Pacific and guarantee the safety of U.S. naval forces. That is enough, we can’t do anymore things.” Japan has one of the biggest and most advanced navies in the world with more than 40 destroyers, four helicopter carriers and around 20 submarines.  “We undertake far more missions than we did in the past. That means we are stretched in some areas but it is our job to complete the job with the equipment we have,” said Fukuda, Kaga’s commander.  CARRIER AMBITION While arguments over the future role of Japan’s navy rage on within the MSDF and defense ministry, proponents of overseas operations appear for now to have gained the upper hand as Abe seeks a larger regional security role for his country.  That could eventually lead to the acquisition of fixed wing aircraft carriers, two military officials told Reuters, asking not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media.  Doing so would put it in an exclusive club of countries including the United States, Russia, Britain and more recently China that able to project air power over long distances. Details on Tokyo’s plans may come before the end of the year, when Japan’s defense ministry will publish two papers outlining its security goals and military procurement plans for the five years beginning in April 2019.  Separate military sources earlier told Reuters those documents will include a commitment to acquire vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) F-35B stealth fighters that could be flown from the deck of the Kaga or its sister ship the Izumo.

156,Democrats would view Rosenstein ouster as an election 'gift',"Democrats believe they stand to benefit if President Donald Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. Justice Department official who oversees the Russia probe, before November’s elections. FILE PHOTO: Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testifies to the House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Justice Department on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 13, 2017.   REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File PhotoBut they disagree about how much they should wield it as a weapon in their battle to take back Congress.  Democratic Party sources and strategists say they know that if Trump fires Rosenstein, he will ignite a firestorm of accusations that the president is attempting to shut down the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election he won. That will likely bolster their argument that Democrats should gain power to serve as a check on the presidency, they say.  “It would be an in-kind contribution to the Democratic Party,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a political action committee that backs Democratic candidates.  This week, Trump is due to hold his first meeting with Rosenstein since a Sept. 21 New York Times report said he considered secretly recording the president as part of a possible effort to remove him from office.  Although Trump has said he wants Rosenstein to stay in the job, axing him would give the White House the chance to put in his place an official who could restrict Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation or perhaps even fire Mueller. For Democrats, the politics of the Russia probe, however, are complicated.  Some worry about making it a centerpiece of campaigns. Polls show candidates getting traction with voters on kitchen-table issues such as healthcare.   Others believe that if Trump removed Rosenstein he would cross a red line and galvanize left-leaning and independent voters in November, further propelling a “Blue Wave” that they hope sweeps the House of Representatives away from Republicans and improves the Democrats’ current long odds of taking the Senate. AT THE PERIPHERY Democrats need to add a net total of two seats in the U.S. Senate to take control from Republicans, while requiring 23 seats in the House to become the majority. But they also must defend Senate seats in states that Trump won in 2016, rural states such as Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia, where voters will be less receptive to a message built around investigating Trump and protecting Mueller.  Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster involved in several Senate races, said the Russia probe is not on the radar of the voters he surveys. “I haven’t seen it in a single (response) in any survey asking voters what they see as the most important issue facing America,” Wilson said. “Not one.” A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found that Americans favor keeping Rosenstein by a 2-to-1 margin, but 35 percent of respondents said they did not have an opinion, suggesting that he remains largely unknown.  Safe-guarding Mueller has been a cause taken up not so much by Democratic candidates but more by Democratic members of Congress with safe seats, such as Representative Adam Schiff of California.  There are other risks in focusing on Russia. Trump has often framed the probe as a vendetta by Democrats angry about losing the 2016 election, and Democratic candidates risk feeding that narrative by dwelling on the investigation.  For similar reasons, Democrats have largely resisted talking about the possibility of impeaching Trump should they win the House, focusing instead on Republican policies such as the massive tax-cut bill passed last year.  Cecil said that should Rosenstein be fired, he does not anticipate his group would release political ads about it. They would instead stay locked on domestic issues, he added, because the media would do its work for it, providing wall-to-wall coverage. “Essentially, you are opening up a two-front battle: One you are paying for and one the administration is gifting you,” Cecil said.  The House Majority PAC, which works to elect Democratic House candidates, similarly said a firing would not divert its focus. Jeb Fain, the group’s communications director, argued that “It’s only going to make clearer the need for a check on Trump and Congress, for upholding a rule of law.” TOO TIMID Mueller is probing whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election and colluded with the Trump campaign. Both Moscow and Trump deny those allegations. Some Democrats maintain that a Rosenstein firing would be a front-burner campaign issue. Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who has funded a campaign to have Trump impeached, is prepared to pump millions into tight Senate races should Trump pull the trigger.  Kevin Mack, the chief strategist for Steyer’s effort, said Democrats have been too timid in challenging Trump’s conduct, nervous about alienating moderate and independent voters.  He said left-wing progressives, particularly millennials and  women, could be more motivated to go to the polls if it meant directly taking on Trump.  The party “has to give Democrats a reason to vote,” Mack said.  Should Rosenstein go, another Democratic group, Red to Blue California, said it plans to make it an issue in two key House races in that state involving Republican representatives Dana Rohrabacher, who has been criticized for his close ties with Russia, and Devin Nunes, who has been a sharp critic of the Russia probe.  A coalition of left-wing advocates, national-security groups and government watchdogs have launched a collective effort to organize protests in the event of a Rosenstein firing. Zac Petkanas, a spokesman for the push, said 900 separate protests nationwide are planned should Trump dump Rosenstein. He said that if Trump makes such a move, it will make the stakes of the Russia investigation, which remains an abstraction for many voters, much more tangible and a potential fuel for Democratic votes in November.  “It won’t be a cable-TV scandal anymore,” Petkanas said. “It will be a real scandal.” ",Politik,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
157,Chaotic scenes in quake-hit Indonesia as bodies lie unclaimed,"Police guarded banks in the Indonesian city of Palu on Monday as residents scrambled to flee and dozens of bodies lay unclaimed in a hospital three days after a major earthquake and tsunami. The confirmed death toll from a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet), rose to 844 but was sure to go higher as rescuers reach remote villages cut off since disaster struck. All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people at the head of a long, narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island. On a hill above the city, authorities used an excavator to claw a long, mass grave from the sandy soil. They are hoping relatives can identify bodies of loved ones before they are buried. But it is a heart-breaking search. “There are a few young girls but I can’t recognize them,” said Lisa, 38, who was at Palu’s hospital looking for her 14-year-old daughter and mother among dozens of bodies in orange bags lined up out the back. They had been at a restaurant on Palu’s beachfront when the tsunami hit. “We ran and ran but the waves caught us. We ran together but I lost them,” she said. “I can’t say how I feel.” Palu appeared to be teetering on the verge of chaos on Monday, with survivors short of food and water, and fuel. Children gathered by roads held out their hands hoping for help from cars streaming out of Palu. About 3,000 people also thronged the city’s small airport hoping to catch a ride on military planes laid on to take people out, most to a provincial capital to the south. Lines of car, several kilometers long, stretched back from filling stations and a Reuters news team saw dozens of people looting one petrol station. Nearby supermarkets were cleared out. People said they had been looted. Mini marts and convenience stores were also empty. FRACTURED ROADS, NO WATER The government has played down fears of looting. Officials say quake victims can take things from shops and the government will pay compensation later. There have been no reports of violence and there was no major security presence on Palu’s streets on Monday but dozens of armed police were guarding city banks. Parts of the city are expanses of devastation - shattered timbers and concrete, broken window frames and roofs. One main road into Palu was blocked by a boat, swept ashore by the tsunami. Workers with heavy machinery were trying to clear debris from another stretch of the road. Many of Palu’s streets are fractured by huge cracks or just gone, swept away into muddy ravines. Leaning lamp posts hold up wires that carry no power. A red and white national flag on a bamboo pole fluttered by one swathe of destruction. Some people poked about the wreckage looking for belongings. “There has been no help from the government,” said one man who identified himself as Ruslan on the outskirts of Palu. “We’ve been eating noodles and any snacks that people passing by give us.” The government says aid, including tonnes of rice, is on the way. Ruslan said the quake had also disrupted water supplies. “We’ve got no water. We’re trying to get whatever we can from the pipes,” he said. A government official said later on Monday a team would be sent to dig new wells. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

The proposed name change is part of an agreement reached in June by pro-Western Prime Minister Zoran Zaev with Greece to resolve the dispute over the country’s name, which had prevented Macedonia from joining NATO or the EU. With 85 percent of votes counted, official turnout was just 36 percent, and election officials made clear there was no chance the threshold would be cleared. “On this referendum, it is clear that the decision has not been made,” election commission head Oliver Derkoski told reporters. The people who did vote overwhelmingly backed the name change — more than 90 percent voted yes with 63 percent of polling stations reporting. But that had never been in doubt, since opponents of the change had urged followers not to vote, rather than vote no.

The referendum was itself not legally binding, but lawmakers had pledged to abide by it, and the failure to reach the turnout threshold means opponents can now freely vote against the deal. The nationalist opposition holds 49 seats in the 120-seat parliament, enough to block the two-thirds majority required to change the constitution. In an address, Zaev made no mention of the turnout but said the votes of those who had backed the change must be respected. He pledged to hold a vote in parliament on the name change, and call an early election if lawmakers failed to enact it. “I am determined to take Macedonia into the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said. He spoke again later in the evening, along similar lines: “It is time to support European Macedonia.” BLOW The Greek foreign ministry said it respected the will of the people of the country, which it refers to by the provisional name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

While polls have long showed that a vast majority of Macedonians want to join NATO and the EU, nationalist opponents of the name change argued that it undermined the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority. The question on the referendum ballot read: “Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece”. Supporters of the name change argued that it was a price worth paying to pursue admission into bodies such as the EU and NATO. “I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can be live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje. But opponents said the name change represented national humiliation. “We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door,” said Vladimir Kavadarkov, who backed the referendum boycott. “We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.” Slideshow (11 Images)",Weltnachrichten,2018-09-29 00:00:00,Reuters
163,French watchdog calms UK asset manager fears over Brexit,"Cooperation agreements for supervising cross-border asset managers will be in place before Britain leaves the European Union next March, France’s top markets regulator said on Monday. Asset managers are worried that if Britain crashes out of the EU next March with no transition deal, they would no longer be able to manage funds listed in the EU under a regime known as delegation. London-based asset managers operate funds listed in Luxembourg and Dublin holding over a trillion euros of assets for customers across the bloc. Robert Ophele, chairman of France’s markets watchdog AMF, said delegation could only be possible if memoranda of understanding (MOUs) have been signed between UK and EU regulators to cooperate in supervision. “This type of MOU is very easy to write. We have them with many many countries and they all look the same,” Ophele told a conference in London organized by financial sector body AFME. “It’s my absolute conviction that we will have that in  force before the Brexit, whatever the Brexit will be,” Ophele said. “It’s not a big deal.” Industry officials say regulators would likely announce the MOUs in November or later, once political talks on Britain’s EU divorce settlement, which includes a transition period, have been concluded. France is seen by UK fund managers as trying to curb delegation in order to put pressure on them to shift senior managers in Britain to new EU hubs. The EU’s European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued guidelines on how far delegation can go, saying that the new EU hubs must have “substance” or sufficient number of senior investment staff. Ophele said Paris-based ESMA’s powers should be bolstered to avoid national regulators across the EU diverging from centrally agreed financial rules for asset managers and other sectors. National regulators should be forced to say publicly if they comply with all of ESMA’s financial sector guidance, he said. Asked if ESMA should become a “super” regulator with much stronger powers like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Ophele replied, “In some cases yes, in other cases not. But it will not happen very rapidly.” ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters
164,"Worried about undercount, states and cities spend to promote 2020 census","By law, the United States government is responsible for conducting a census every 10 years to count all of the country’s residents. But in the lead-up to the 2020 census, state and local leaders have made it clear they will not rely on the federal government to ensure an accurate count. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke arrives at the presentation of the 2010 Census U.S. population at the National Press Club in Washington December 21, 2010. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File PhotoState governments, foundations and local governments are committing hundreds of millions of dollars to convince people to fill out their census forms, in what is likely to be the most expensive grassroots census campaign ever. The stakes are high: Population data collected in the census not only serves to allocate congressional seats; it also determines how the federal government divides an estimated $800 billion each year for such things as public housing, highway construction, Head Start, Medicaid and Medicare. An undercount could cost states billions of dollars in federal revenue.  Some of the groups most likely to receive federal aid are also among those most often missed by the census. The Census Bureau’s own analysis found that it undercounted young children by 4.6 percent in the 2010 census and missed 1.1 percent of renters (a category sometimes used as a proxy for low-income residents). Homeowners were over-enumerated by more than half-a-percent.      States with large immigrant populations are particularly worried for 2020. They say they have seen widespread distrust of government among immigrants because of heightened immigration enforcement. And for the first time in 70 years, the Census Bureau intends to ask all people whether they are U.S. citizens, a question many worry will further suppress immigrant participation. More than two dozen states and cities are suing to get the question removed.  California has said it will spend $100 million on outreach, dwarfing the $2 million it spent on the 2010 census, when the state had a severe budget crisis, and the $25 million it spent in 2000. Salt Lake City has budgeted $80,000 to hire its first-ever census director. New York City has allocated $4.3 million, the first time it has formally budgeted for census outreach.  In addition to state and local governments, some 74 grant-makers nationwide have committed $30 million to census efforts. Even so, government and nonprofit leaders across the country expressed doubt in interviews that money alone will be enough to coax wary populations to raise their hands. “Certain communities,” said New York City Deputy Mayor J. Phillip Thompson, “may just be too frightened to participate.” ‘IT’S A TRICK’ The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials has been running focus groups to identify effective ways of maximizing census participation. The group’s chief executive, Arturo Vargas, said the citizenship question raised alarm bells in focus groups conducted with immigrants, and that participants said they had little confidence their data would be kept private. They also worried about completing census forms online, another innovation of this year’s census. “My mom is 61 years old and she’s not going to go on the computer,” said one focus group respondent. “She’ll think it’s a trick.” NALEO’s research found that immigrants responded positively to messaging that cited their legal obligation to complete the census. Younger Latino men responded well to ads portraying the census as a way to defend their communities. Traditional messaging emphasizing civic responsibility “ain’t gonna work,” said Allan Oliver, of the Santa Fe, N.M.-based Thornburg Foundation. Many state and local officials expressed concern that the citizenship question in particular would depress participation. “Citizenship might be relevant to the federal government, but for those of us who run local governments, we have to treat the sewage,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer, whose county has appointed an advisory board to help boost participation. “I don’t know if it’s generated by a citizen or not.”  Los Angeles Census Director Maria de la Luz Garcia said the city’s efforts have focused on practical concerns, including planning for computers at local libraries to perform double duty as kiosks for filling out census forms and preparing to include census reminders in city utility bills.  The bureau has said it can conduct the 2020 census more cheaply because, with online responses, it will be able to hire fewer enumerators than in 2010 and open fewer field offices.  But some local government officials say their constituents will need human contact and encouragement in this census more than ever. Every person not counted will ultimately cost his or her state $19,500 over the next decade, a study by George Washington University’s Andrew Reamer estimated. California, for example, lost out on at least $1.5 billion of aid due to uncounted residents after the 2000 census, a PricewaterhouseCoopers study found. FUNDERS CIRCLE  Philanthropic groups in 21 states so far have formed state-level census outreach efforts, in many cases for the first time.  In rural New Mexico, where getting an accurate count has always been difficult, a group led by the Thornburg Foundation and the Albuquerque Community Foundation are aiming to raise $600,000. In Minnesota, which has the nation’s largest Somali population, foundations have designed a $4.8 million campaign, asking Minnesota’s government to chip in $1.25 million. The foundation-led New York Counts 2020 coalition plans to raise $3 million, and is urging the state’s government to pony up much more, citing California’s example.  Ditas Katague, who oversees census outreach for California, said that even with the state’s $100 million campaign, the task is difficult. “We’re way ahead of where we were in 2000 and 2010,” Katague said. “But the feeling is that we’re behind.” ",Politik,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

166,SEC’s focus on U.S. corporate bosses pays off with Musk settlement,"A high-profile settlement with Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk exemplifies a recent push by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go after executives and not just their companies, securities law experts said. In the last week, the SEC announced charges or penalties against eight corporate officials at six companies, including Tesla. The SEC pursued each on different grounds, but securities lawyers said they highlight a shift to an emphasis on personal wrongdoing that has accelerated under Jay Clayton, an appointee of U.S. President Donald Trump who has served as SEC chairman since May 2017. “Clayton is focused on holding individuals liable and not just corporate entities,” said Mary Hansen, co-chair of the white collar defense and corporate investigations practice at Drinker Biddle, who worked in the SEC’s enforcement division for eight years. “The public wants to see our law enforcement, whether it be civil or criminal, hold those individuals responsible. That’s what is driving this focus on individual liability.” The SEC brought action last week against the former president and chief financial officer of LendingClub Asset Management, Renaud Laplanche and Carrie Dolan, and the former CEO and CFO of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O), Gregory Wasson and Wade Miquelon.  In Tesla’s case, the SEC fined Musk $20 million and forced him to step down as chairman to settle charges he committed securities fraud in tweets saying he was considering taking the electric carmaker private. Tesla itself was also fined $20 million. “Holding individuals accountable is important and an effective means of deterrence,” Clayton, a former corporate lawyer at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, said in statement on Saturday. Some Democratic lawmakers had expressed concerns during Clayton’s confirmation process that his ties to Wall Street would create conflicts and weaken oversight. In 2016, 73 percent of the SEC’s standalone actions involved charges against one or more individuals, according to its own data. That rose to 80 percent in the six months after Clayton took over. FILE PHOTO: Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk reveals the Tesla Energy Powerwall Home Battery during an event in Hawthorne, California, U.S., April 30, 2015.  REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon/File PhotoCALLS FOR INDIVIDUAL PROSECUTIONS The SEC’s focus on personal culpability has roots in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Few Wall Street executives were criminally prosecuted for their involvement, triggering calls by lawmakers and the media to hold more individuals accountable for corporate wrongdoing. Proving individual wrongdoing and malicious intent is more difficult and resource-intensive than identifying compliance lapses at companies, legal experts said, explaining the SEC’s previous reluctance to pursue such cases.  “There is a terrible deterrent effect if you lose because it lets people know you can just fight off the regulators. That’s a bad message to the markets,” said Minor Myers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and expert on corporate governance. But political support from both Republicans and Democrats to go after individuals has emboldened the SEC.  Despite their traditional allegiance to the corporate world, Republicans have supported charges against executives, looking to uphold individual accountability and protect big employers and public company shareholders.    And Democrats have been hungry for prosecutions of those who they consider to be the corrupt fat cats of corporate America. To be sure, pursuing individuals remains a risky legal strategy for the SEC. With more to lose, including large disgorgements, fines and lifetime bans, executives are more likely to fight back in court, sucking up SEC resources.  The SEC suffered a high-profile defeat in the insider trading case of flamboyant billionaire Mark Cuban in 2013 when he was cleared by a Texas jury of using a private tip to avoid a big loss on his 2004 sale of internet company shares.  One of the lawyers Musk tapped to defend himself against the SEC, Latham & Watkins LLP’s Christopher Clark, also advised Cuban on his defense. But as the SEC scores more legal wins and settlements such as one the with Musk, its enforcement officers feel emboldened to pursue even more cases against individuals, legal experts said.    “There is a huge appetite for going after people at the top of the pyramid. Those are the people you want to deter. Also, going after CEOs who have engaged in wrongdoing is a way for the SEC to generate a lot of political capital,” said Myers.

167,Fast and serious: Vietnam's first domestic car manufacturer bets big,"At a time when auto companies in the developed world are facing a squeeze on their profits from cash-rich tech firms, Vietnam is betting car-making can be a ticket t o a more prosperous economy, just as it was for the likes of Japan and South Korea. Vinfast factory is seen in Hai Phong city, Vietnam September 25, 2018.  REUTERS/KhamVinFast, a unit of Vietnam’s largest conglomerate Vingroup JSC VIC.HM, is set to become the country’s first fully-fledged domestic car manufacturer when its first production models built under its own badge hit the streets next August. “Where else in the world can you do this with this sort of speed?” said Shaun Calvert, vice president of manufacturing at VinFast Trading and Production LLC, looking out over an area of factory floor where nine months earlier there was only sea. Calvert was speaking on a recent tour of the company’s new plant, a sprawling island complex in the northern Vietnamese port town of Haiphong, where the two models will be built.  From a standing start, VinFast will have the capacity to produce 250,000 cars annually in the next five years or so, equivalent to 92 percent of all the cars sold in Vietnam last year, according to data collated by the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (VAMA). Vingroup says it only embarked on creating VinFast a little over a year ago and has earmarked about $3.5 billion for the project. “We are driving the rapid expansion of the domestic automobile market so we are absolutely focused on winning here first,” CEO Jim Deluca said ahead of the Paris Motor Show this week, where VinFast will reveal its first export markets. “We’re looking to expand both within ASEAN and outside.” Most cars sold in Vietnam are foreign brands assembled in the country from kits. But a series of free trade agreements have reduced import duties and are opening up the market. A 30 percent import tax on cars from other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries was scrapped this year. ELECTRIC SCOOTERS Vingroup already dominates the real estate market in Vietnam with Vinhomes, has entered the healthcare market with Vinmec, runs a chain of supermarkets called Vinmart, and entertains tourists at Vinpearl resorts. “There’s probably 4 million customers today who are associated with Vingroup in one way or another so it’s a huge brand, it’s an aspirational brand, and those customers are ready for a domestic VinFast product,” said Deluca. In a country synonymous with the motorbikes that zip around the clogged streets of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, VinFast will also produce 250,000 electric scooters a year alongside the 250,000 cars, in an ambitious production target that’s set to eventually increase to 1 million units each a year.  VinFast has also started on the development of a battery electric vehicle with Germany’s EDAG Engineering (ED4.DE), to be introduced in the future, Deluca added. Slideshow (2 Images)“We felt on the car portfolio it was best to start with an internal combustion engine and then soon after that launch the battery electric vehicle,” said Deluca. “From an infrastructure perspective, it’s a lot easier to charge a scooter than it is an automobile.” The speed with which VinFast has moved has partly been possible due to a reliance on off-the-shelf parts. VinFast’s first two models, an SUV and a small sedan, are being built on a frame from BMW (BMWG.DE). The components have been engineered by Canadian firm Magna International’s (MG.TO) Magna Steyr, while design work has been done by Italian design house Pininfarina (PNNI.MI). “That gives us the ability to move very, very quickly and to come out with a vehicle that is 100 percent ours and looks like no other vehicles that are on the road today,” Deluca said. “NATIONAL PRIDE” The company has also imported foreign expertise. At least five of the VinFast leadership team, including Deluca and Calvert, are veterans of General Motors Co (GM.N).     In June, the U.S. automobile giant agreed to transfer full ownership of its Hanoi factory to VinFast for the Vietnamese firm to produce small cars under a GM global license from 2019. But, despite the institutional experience VinFast has acquired, a move into the highly competitive automobile industry is not without significant risks. Local auto assembly companies have tried - and failed - in Vietnam to sell home-grown models to the masses. Regionally, companies such as Malaysia’s Proton or Australia’s Holden have struggled to gain traction outside their home countries. “The key question is why the world needs yet another car brand in a era when hardware is commoditising,” said Bill Russo, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Ltd and a former Chrysler executive. “The fact that they have outsourced design and manufacturing and are relying on foreign R&D tells me they are following a traditional path that may not be competitive in an era of digital mobility services.”     Bui Ngoc Huyen, chairman of Vinaxuki, which tried to establish a domestic automaker but ceased production in 2012 before its first car was officially launched, said Vingroup’s deep pockets should help, but warned that building a brand would take time. “You have to move from producing small and cheap cars to luxury ones,” he said. “It will take several years for a new carmaker to fine tune its products and win the confidence of consumers. It will take between 10 and 20 years.” Deluca said VinFast’s early models would be “very affordable” to lure local buyers, but declined to give details of pricing. But in Vietnam, where hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets with flares and flags to celebrate moderate success after under-23 football games, VinFast is banking on an additional competitive edge “We think national pride is a tremendous advantage for VinFast,” said Deluca. “What we’re doing here is something special for the men and women of Vietnam”.

169,"Sunk costs: Airports taking action against rising seas, storms as climate changes","Global airport operators, faced with rising sea levels and more powerful storms as the climate changes, are starting to invest in measures including higher runways, seawalls and better drainage systems to future-proof immovable assets. FILE PHOTO: Planes are surrounded by flood waters caused by Tropical Storm Harvey at the West Houston Airport in Texas, U.S. August 30, 2017. REUTERS/Adrees Latif/File PhotoIn early September, a seawall at Japan’s Kansai International Airport built on a reclaimed island near Osaka, was breached during Typhoon Jebi.  The runway was flooded and it took 17 days to fully restore airport operations, at a high cost to the region’s economy as well as the dozens of airlines that canceled flights.  Major airports in Hong Kong, mainland China and North Carolina were also closed due to tropical storms last month. Such incidents highlight the disaster risks to investors and insurers exposed to a sector with an estimated $262 billion of projects under construction globally, according to Fitch Solutions. “There is a kind of one-way direction with regards to the frequency and severity of climate change-related events,” said Fitch Solutions Head of Infrastructure Richard Marshall. “If people aren’t taking that seriously, that is a risk.” Fifteen of the 50 most heavily trafficked airports globally are at an elevation of less than 30 feet above sea level, making them particularly vulnerable to a changing climate, including rising sea levels and associated higher storm surges.  “You see it at individual airports that are already seeing sea rise and are already dealing with water on their runway,” Airports Council International (ACI) Director General Angela Gittens said, citing examples in island nations including Vanuatu and the Maldives.  “But even in some of these mature economies they are having more storms, they are having to do more pumping. My old airport in Miami is in that scenario.”  A draft copy of an ACI policy paper reviewed by Reuters and due to be released this week warns of the rising risks to facilities from climate change. It encourages member airports to conduct risk assessments, develop mitigation measures and take it into account in future master plans.  The paper cites examples of forward-thinking airports that have taken climate change into account in planning, such as the $12 billion Istanbul Grand Airport on the Black Sea, set to become one of the world’s largest airports when it opens next month. INVESTOR INTEREST Debt investors in particular have high exposure to airports, most of which are owned by governments or pension funds. Ratings agency Moody’s alone has $174 billion of airport bonds under coverage. FILE PHOTO: An MH-65T Dolphin helicopter aircrew from Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City looks over LaGuardia Airport while it  conducts an over flight assessment of New York Boroughs impacted by Hurricane Sandy, October 30, 2012.   REUTERS/U.S. Coast Guard/Handout/File Photo.    Earl Heffintrayer, the lead analyst covering U.S. airports at Moody’s, said the risk of climate change became apparent to investors after Superstorm Sandy closed major New York airports for days in 2012.  Sandy led to the cancellation of nearly 17,000 flights, costing airlines $500 million in revenues and disrupting operations around the world, according to a 2017 presentation by Eurocontrol on climate change risk.  Investors are increasingly asking about mitigation plans at low-lying airports like San Francisco and Boston as they look to invest in bonds with terms of up to 30 years, Heffintrayer said. San Francisco International Airport, built on reclaimed land that is slowly sinking, has completed a feasibility study on a $383 million project to make the airport more resilient to sea level rises on its 8 miles (12.9 km) of bay front shoreline by 2025.     “We are seeing a lot more thought going into protection against flood damage, catastrophe, making sure that the storm drains around the airport are fit for purpose,” said Gary Moran, head of Asia aviation at insurance broker Aon. “There definitely is a lot more thought going into potential further worsening in weather conditions further down the line.” TAKING ACTION Singapore’s Changi Airport [CHAP.UL], which has analyzed scenarios out to 2100, has resurfaced its runways to provide for better drainage and is building a new terminal at a higher 18 feet (5.5 meters) above sea level to protect against rising seas. Moran said such steps were prudent and would provide comfort to insurers. “If you were to look at Singapore, if something was to happen at Changi in terms of weather-related risk, Singapore would have a problem,” he said. “There isn’t really too much of an alternative.” Singapore expects sea levels to rise by 2.5 feet (0.76 meter) by 2100. Changi Airport declined to comment on the cost of the extra protection.  ACI, Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s were unable to provide Reuters with an estimate of the global cost of climate change protection at airports. The protective action is often folded into larger refurbishment and expansion projects, ratings agency analysts said. In Australia, Brisbane Airport [BAIRP.UL] and located on reclaimed land on the coast at just 13 feet (4 meters) above sea level, is constructing a new runway 3.3 feet (1 meter) higher than it otherwise would have done, with a higher seawall and better drainage systems as sea levels rise. Paul Coughlan, the director of Brisbane Airport’s new runway project, said the incremental cost of such moves was relatively low - for example the seawall cost around A$5 million ($3.6 million) more than without taking into account sea level rises - but the potential benefits were big. “At the end of the day, whether you are a believer in climate change or a disbeliever, doing a design that accounts for elevated sea levels, more intense rainfall, flooding considerations, that is just prudent,” Coughlan said.

170,Canada's Husky Energy offers to buy MEG Energy in $5 billion deal,"Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Energy Inc (HSE.TO) said on Sunday it has made an unsolicited bid to acquire rival MEG Energy Corp (MEG.TO) in a deal valued at C$6.4 billion ($5 billion) including debt. FILE PHOTO: Banners for the Canadian company Husky Energy are seen at a sporting event in Lake Louise, Alberta December 1, 2009. REUTERS/Andy Clark    The combined company would have total production of more than 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and refining and upgrading capacity of about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), Husky said in a statement.  The offer comes as many Canadian oil producers have struggled with transportation bottlenecks as output has surged, pushing Canadian heavy crude to near-historic discounts to U.S. light crude. Husky Chief Executive Rob Peabody told Reuters that the combination of MEG’s top-quality assets and staff with its own production and downstream network would allow MEG to circumvent some of the effects from the Canadian crude discount, and provide benefits for both sets of shareholders. The Husky offer comes less than two months into the tenure of Derek Evans, an industry veteran who took over as chief executive of MEG in August. MEG Energy’s board will consider and evaluate the Husky’s unsolicited offer and the related takeover bid circular, if and when received, MEG said in a statement. MEG said it has formed a special committee of independent directors and has retained financial and legal advisers. “No formal offer has been made,” MEG said. “MEG shareholders are advised to take no action with respect to any Husky offer until the Board of Directors has had an opportunity to fully review the offer, when received, and to make a recommendation as to its merits.” Under the terms of the proposal, MEG shareholders will have the option to choose to receive consideration of C$11 in cash or 0.485 of a Husky share for every share held. That offer is subject to a maximum aggregate cash consideration of C$1 billion and a maximum aggregate number of Husky shares issued of about 107 million.  “The MEG Board of Directors has refused to engage in a discussion on the merits of a transaction, giving us no option but to bring this offer directly to MEG shareholders,” Peabody said in the statement. Husky’s offer delivers a 44 percent premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average MEG share price of C$7.62 as of Friday, and a 37 percent premium to MEG’s Friday close of C$8.03.  Goldman Sachs Canada Inc is acting as financial adviser and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP is acting as lead legal adviser to Husky. The proposal, which has been unanimously approved by Husky’s board of directors, is expected to result in C$200 million per year in near-term, realizable synergies.

FILE PHOTO: Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen sits in the new Volkswagen Passat during the press day for the North American International Auto show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 10, 2011.  REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File PhotoFormer Governor Phil Bredesen and U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn are locked in an unexpectedly close race in deeply conservative Tennessee. Democrats see the race as an opportunity to win one of the two additional seats they need to wrest control of the Senate from Republicans and gain the power to slow or stop elements of U.S. President Donald Trump’s populist conservative agenda. “The number one issue for Tennesseans has got to be the overarching issue of how dysfunctional Washington has become,” said Bredesen, 74. “It’s become hyperpartisan. It’s become almost impossible to get things done.” Once a reliably Democratic state, Tennessee has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since Bredesen’s 2006 gubernatorial victory. Trump won the southern state by more than 20 points in 2016, though retiring Senator Bob Corker, who holds the seat Bredesen and Blackburn are vying for, has become one of his most vocal Republican critics. Blackburn tried to tie Bredesen to national Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump’s former rival Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama. A vote for Bredesen, she said repeatedly, “is a vote for Chuck Schumer,” though Bredesen said he would not vote for Schumer in a leadership role. The president has endorsed Blackburn, 66, and is due in the state next week to campaign for her, but neither candidate made much mention of Trump during the debate at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee. Blackburn echoed many of the Trump administration’s buzzwords, saying she wanted to “drain the swamp” in Washington and end sanctuary city policies, under which many jurisdictions limit the interactions of local police with immigration enforcement. “Democrats are focused on taking away your Second Amendment rights,” she said when asked about gun control. “That is something that is paramount for them.” Polls over the past few weeks have shown a tight race, with experts saying that Bredesen must win over independents and Republicans in addition to Democrats to win. A poll last week by the Republican firm Vox Populi Polling gave the Democrat a 2 percentage point lead over Blackburn. The poll had a 4 percent margin of error. Both candidates criticized Trump’s trade policies, which have hurt farmers in the state, through Blackburn described the tariffs as a necessary economic defense. Asked to name a Trump policy that he agreed with, Bredesen praised the president’s efforts to win concessions from North Korea, saying he was willing to give Trump “some elbow room” to find ways to deal with the state and its autocratic leader, Kim Jong Un. Blackburn reiterated her support for Trump’s latest Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, despite accusations of teenage sexual misconduct. Bredesen said he would want to hear from Kavanaugh’s accuser before deciding.

173,Trump calls allegations against Kavanaugh a 'con game',"President Donald Trump, fighting to shore up his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court in a divided Senate, on Tuesday called sexual misconduct allegations against the judge “a con game being played by the Democrats.” Trump’s escalation in his rhetoric defending Kavanaugh came as the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee announced the hiring of a woman lawyer who is “an expert sex crimes prosecutor” to question one of the nominee’s accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, at a high-stakes hearing scheduled on Thursday. The committee also scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination for Friday at 9:30 a.m.. Senior Senate Republicans said a vote in the full Senate could happen as early as next Tuesday. In a break from convention, the outside lawyer, whose name was not released, will question Ford and Kavanaugh on behalf of the committee’s Republican senators, 11 white men. Typically, senators do the questioning themselves. Senate Republicans have chosen Rachel Mitchell, a sex crimes prosecutor in Maricopa County, Arizona, to conduct the questioning, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unnamed Republican aide. The move to bring in an outside attorney brought a rebuke from Senator Kamala Harris, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee.  “By hiring a private attorney to cross-examine Dr. Blasey Ford, Republicans are trying to intimidate her and avoid being held accountable by voters,” Harris said in a Twitter posting. Senate confirmation of Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge chosen by Trump for a lifetime post on the high court, has been imperiled by the decades-old allegations by Ford and another woman, Deborah Ramirez. Verwandte ThemenMcConnell says Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh will be confirmedLawyer, not Republican senators, to question Kavanaugh, accuser: lawmakerTrump questions credibility of second Kavanaugh accuser“We’re going to be moving forward,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. “I’m confident we’re going to win, confident that he’ll be confirmed in the very near future.” Ford, a university professor in California, has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when both were high school students in Maryland. Ramirez accused Kavanaugh in an article published on Sunday in the New Yorker magazine of exposing himself to her at a drunken dormitory party during the 1983-84 academic year at Yale University. Kavanaugh has denied both allegations. Trump said Ford’s allegation was 36 years old “and nobody ever heard about it.” Of Ramirez’s allegation, Trump said: “And now a new charge comes up. And she says: ‘Well it might not be him.’ And there were gaps. And she said she was totally inebriated, and she was all messed up, and she doesn’t know it was him, but it might have been him.” “Oh, gee, let’s not make him a Supreme Court judge because of that? This is a con game being played by the Democrats,” Trump added. Asked whether Ramirez should also be allowed to testify, Trump said: “The second accuser has nothing.” In response to Trump’s comments, Ramirez’s attorney John Clune told CNN that “politicians are going to say what they want to say but that doesn’t mean what Debbie disclosed is not true.” The Kavanaugh confirmation fight comes just weeks before Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are trying to take control of Congress from Trump’s fellow Republicans, against a backdrop of the #MeToo movement fighting sexual harassment and assault. Kavanaugh’s confirmation would firm up conservative control of the Supreme Court and advance Trump’s goal of moving the high court and the broader federal judiciary to the right.

REUTERS/Alex Wroblewski/File PhotoKavanaugh and his Republican allies have framed the allegations as part of a “smear campaign” by Democrats who have opposed his nomination from the beginning. ‘A DIFFERENT DECISION’ Republicans hold a slim 51-49 Senate majority, meaning Kavanaugh’s confirmation prospects may hinge on the votes of a handful of moderate Republican senators who have not yet announced their intentions, They include Senators Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Jeff Flake. Comments by Murkowski on Tuesday after she met with McConnell could be an ominous sign for Kavanaugh. Murkowski told reporters: “We have kind of moved beyond the qualifications of the nominee, and it has become more about whether or not women who have been subject to any form of assault, violence, intimidation are to (be) believed. That’s a different decision than ‘is Judge Kavanaugh qualified?’” McConnell said the outside lawyer would question Ford “in a respectful and professional way.” The panel’s Democratic senators, four women and six men, were expected to question Ford and Kavanaugh but those details were still not final, Senator Dick Durbin said. Ford’s legal team on Monday had objected to the possibility Republicans would use an outside lawyer to question her. Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, said in an interview published in the Washington Post last week that Kavanaugh attacked her and tried to remove her clothing while he was drunk at a party when he was 17 years old and she was 15. In an interview with Fox News aired on Monday night, Kavanaugh said he “never sexually assaulted anyone,” had “always treated women with dignity and respect” and “did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.” Regarding alcohol, he said he never drank so much that he could not remember what happened the night before. “I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit, but that’s not what we’re talking about. We’re talking about an allegation of sexual assault. I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone,” Kavanaugh said in the interview, sitting alongside his wife. “I’m a good person,” Kavanaugh added.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh testifies during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his nomination be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., September 27, 2018. Tom Williams/Pool via REUTERSThe poll, released on Sunday, follows an emotionally charged week in Washington, during which Kavanaugh’s once-certain confirmation was jeopardized after three women made allegations against him, including accusations of assault and exposing himself in public in the 1980s.  Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge nominated to the country’s top court by U.S. President Donald Trump, has denied those allegations. The FBI has opened an investigation after Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans. The poll found that 42 percent of adults said they believed the accusations, including about the same number of men and women. Thirty-one percent do not believe them and 27 percent said they “don’t know” what to believe.  The responses were divided largely along partisan lines - about two-thirds of Democrats said they believed the allegations and nearly two-thirds of Republicans said they did not.  One of the women accusing Kavanaugh of misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that when they were teenagers in 1982, Kavanaugh and a friend pushed her into a room and that he held her down and tried to take off her clothes.  Ford said she feared that she would be raped and accidentally killed.  Kavanaugh told the committee afterward that he considered the allegations part of a “calculated and orchestrated political hit” from Democrats who do not want him confirmed. He said he did not know any of the women who have accused him of wrongdoing and he produced calendars from the time that he said exonerated him. A recent YouGov poll found that the country was split over the testimony that Kavanaugh and Ford presented to the panel, with 41 percent saying that they believed Ford and 35 percent saying they believed Kavanaugh. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted after the allegations were publicized, also found that 41 percent of adults opposed Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. That was up about 5 percentage points from a similar poll conducted from Sept. 18-24.  When it came to the allegations of sexual misconduct, the poll found that Americans who are younger, more educated and single were more likely to believe the allegations than those who are older, less educated and married.  The poll was conducted online in English from Sept. 26-30 throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 2,478 American adults, including 983 who identify as Democrats and 818 who identify as Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points. ",Politik,2018-09-30 00:00:00,Reuters

The American flag flies near the national emblem of China outside of the Bayi Building before a welcome ceremony for U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in Beijing, Wednesday, June 27, 2018 Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via ReutersThe official, who is involved in China policy and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was not clear if or when the meeting would be rescheduled. The cancellation was first reported by the New York Times. The official said it was not clear whether the cancellation was because of the broad range of disputes between Beijing and Washington on issues such as arms sales and military activity in the South China Sea and other waters around China. China and the United States are also locked in a spiraling trade war that has seen them level increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other’s imports. “The tension is escalating, and that could prove to be dangerous to both sides,” the official said. The U.S. State Department declined comment. Officials at the White House and Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China’s Foreign and Defense Ministries also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sources in Beijing briefed on the matter said last week the security meeting may not take place because of the tensions in relations between the two countries. The Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Friday there was “no cause for panic” over friction between Beijing and Washington, but warned that China would not be blackmailed or yield to pressure over trade. At a U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday, President Donald Trump accused Beijing of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections to stop him and his Republican Party from doing well because of his China trade policies. Trump provided no evidence for his allegation. At the same meeting, Wang rejected the charge. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-10-01 00:00:00,Reuters

185,"After chaotic day, Rosenstein stays in job but will meet with Trump","President Donald Trump and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election, will meet on Thursday to discuss whether Rosenstein will stay in his job. Rosenstein had spent the weekend contemplating whether he should resign after a New York Times report last week said he had suggested secretly recording Trump in 2017, a source told Reuters. The White House announced the meeting on Monday after a flurry of conflicting media reports about whether Rosenstein, a frequent target of Trump’s anger, would be leaving the post.  “At the request of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he and President Trump had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Twitter. Trump, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, told reporters he would meet with Rosenstein on Thursday when he returns to Washington. “We’ll be meeting at the White House and we’ll be determining what’s going on,” Trump said. “We want to have transparency, we want to have openness, and I look forward to meeting with Rod at that time.” Verwandte ThemenFactbox: Who would oversee the Mueller investigation after Rosenstein?Instant View: Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein heads to White House amid reports he will resignThe Rosenstein furor, kicked off by unconfirmed reports that he had verbally resigned, underscored the mounting tension in the White House over the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election. There had been widespread speculation that Trump would fire Rosenstein since Friday when a New York Times report said that in 2017 Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording the president and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from office. The Times said none of those proposals came to fruition.  Rosenstein denied the report as “inaccurate and factually incorrect.” Shortly after the Times story, Trump told supporters at a rally in Missouri that there is “a lingering stench” at the Justice Department and that “we’re going to get rid of that, too.”     FATE OF INVESTIGATION Rosenstein’s departure would prompt questions about the future of Mueller’s investigation and whether Trump, who has called the probe a “witch hunt,” would seek to remove Mueller. The investigation has resulted in indictments or guilty pleas from 32 people. The Rosenstein furor came just six weeks ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections, and his removal could become an explosive political issue as Trump’s fellow Republicans try to keep control of Congress. Thursday’s meeting between Trump and Rosenstein is set for the same day that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexual misconduct are scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing.

REUTERS/Chris WattieIf Rosenstein resigns, Trump has more leeway on replacing him while firing him would make it harder for Trump to designate a successor. Rosenstein’s future ignited a series of conflicting reports on Monday, with the Axios news website cited an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter as saying he had verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Other reports said Rosenstein expected to be fired while NBC News reported Rosenstein said he would not resign and the White House would have to fire him. U.S. Treasury yields fell as much as 2 basis points after the Axios report, signaling investor concern but later pared losses. The S&P 500 also ticked down briefly but recovered most of its losses.  Rosenstein has defended Mueller and been a target of Trump since he assumed supervision of the Russia investigation after his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself because of his own contacts with Russia’s ambassador to Washington while serving as a Trump campaign adviser became public. Trump also has blasted Sessions frequently and said last week “I don’t have an attorney general.” Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said he was “deeply concerned” about the reports of Rosenstein stepping down, saying his departure would put the federal probe into Russian election activities at risk. “There is nothing more important to the integrity of law enforcement and the rule of law than protecting the investigation of Special Counsel (Robert) Mueller,” McCabe said in a statement. McCabe was fired by Sessions in March after the Justice Department’s internal watchdog accused him of misconduct. McCabe charged that he was targeted for being a witness into whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

RILEY FBR, INC, FT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA:  “If Rosenstein resigns, as opposed to being fired, then I expect very little market impact. It is certainly his right to resign. If it turns out that Rosenstein is fired then the markets may react to President Trump making the decision and what it might mean for Mr. Mueller’s tenure. There is a large question now also about the longevity of Mr. Sessions and it is never good when the government shows signs of mayhem. All of this could have a negative effect on the dollar. In terms of the midterms, I think the jury is still out. Public sentiment could swing quickly one way or another as details come out about Judge Kavanaugh’s situation along with the public’s perception of the DOJ and the FBI. I am not a believer yet in some sort of “Blue Wave.”  “I can say, that after 44 years on the Street, that the markets do not like commotion, uncertainty and chaos and all three seem to be present now. It may not be “Buyer Beware,” but anyone with a portfolio of equities or debt should be in the “Owner Beware” position.” KEN POLCARI, DIRECTOR OF THE NYSE FLOOR DIVISION AT O’NEIL SECURITIES IN NEW YORK:  “I would imagine that is kind of what dragged the market lower even though in and of itself it doesn’t price stocks. But the news is negative enough to put pressure on the market along with the China tariffs and Kavanaugh stuff.  “The Rosenstein stuff is just another negative story that is piling on top of the other negative stories out there today, China obviously being the biggest negative, that is the one that really has the potential to price stocks. Kavanaugh and Rosenstein don’t have the potential to price stocks but they do have the potential to add more negative conversation. It gives people a reason to take money off the table.  “I don’t necessarily think it’s a complete disaster, once investors start to put the Kavanaugh stuff and the Rosenstein stuff in its rightful place, stocks will find a rebalance and they will stop selling off. Nothing has happened here that we didn’t know was going to happen. The 10 percent tariffs went into effect, then the Chinese retaliatory tariffs went into effect – that is not new news – everyone knew it was going to happen. That is why most of it is just a knee-jerk reaction.” MICHAEL O’ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, JONESTRADING, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT:     “The Rosenstein headline seemed to be what created the last push down (in stocks)... I think it’s just further lack of clarity from the administration and the direction it’s going. I don’t think people are truly alarmed yet, but that’s probably in the back of people’s minds.     “But people are in a holding pattern here. There is that looming fear that the administration will accelerate the (next round of tariffs), so it makes it hard to go out and buy if you know there’s another potentially negative headline to come out.” JOE MANIMBO, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, WESTERN UNION BUSINESS SOLUTION, WASHINGTON: “It’s not a complete shock that Rosenstein resigned given the recent headlines. This is certainly keeping political uncertainty at an elevated level before the mid-term elections and a reason for caution in financial markets. If things get out of hand, I expect the dollar to get some additional support here, on top of the rate outlook from the Federal Reserve.” TOM SIMONS, MONEY MARKET ECONOMIST AT JEFFERIES & CO. IN NEW YORK “It seems like that’s what’s moving the Treasury market, but to be honest, I’m not sure why the move is so big. It appears that stocks are coming off, which may or may not be related to the news. But in light of that the Treasury rally makes sense.  “It creates a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to happen with the Mueller investigation, but I’m surprised that this would be a risk-off move. In some sense, Trump is very good for the economy and markets. If he were to appoint someone to replace Rosenstein and that were to weaken the teeth of the Mueller investigation, you would think that would clear the way for more pragmatism on the economy and less distraction from the investigation.  It’s possible it’s just a bit of a shock, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this reverses once people put that into perspective.”  MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Stocks extended losses on the news, with the S&P hitting a session low, down 0.5 percent, but then retraced some losses and was last down 0.3 percent.

FILE PHOTO: White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway takes part in a forum called Generation Next at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo“I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape,” Conway told CNN while defending the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by one woman and sexual misconduct by two other women. “I’m a victim of sexual assault,” Conway said. Conway and White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The court nomination has been upended by the allegations, and President Donald Trump was forced to order the FBI to look into them after several moderate Republicans, whose votes could be crucial for Kavanaugh’s confirmation, called for a probe. One Kavanaugh accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, detailed her allegation in testimony before a Senate panel on Thursday that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school in the 1980s. Appearing afterward before the committee, Kavanaugh repeated his categorical denial. The swirling allegations have led other sexual assault victims to come forward to tell their stories. Conway suggested on Sunday that the ire of many victims was improperly pointed at Republican supporters of Kavanaugh, as opposed to the perpetrators of the assaults. “It’s not a meeting of the #MeToo movement,” she told CNN. “It’s raw partisan politics.” For the past 12 months, women and men have shared stories of sexual harassment and abuse under the social media hashtag ‘#MeToo.’ In that time, the careers of a number of prominent men in entertainment, politics and finance have been toppled in the face of accusations of sexual misconduct.

189,Main Iraqi Kurdish party says it may reject regional election result,"One of the dominant Kurdish parties in northern Iraq said it might not recognize the results of Sunday’s parliamentary election and then appeared to backtrack, injecting uncertainty into a region demoralized by a failed independence bid. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said in a statement its decision to ignore results in several provinces, which have yet to be announced, was based on what it described as violations in the voting process.  The statement was later withdrawn but Karwan Anwar, the head of the PUK media office, told Reuters that the party would reject results in all provinces. Some party officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Qubad Talabani, said it was too early to judge the results. The PUK is competing with its long-time rival the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in the election as discontent grows with perceived corruption and economic hardship. With a weak opposition, the political dynasties were expected to enjoy a smooth extension of their power in the land of six million people, which gained semi-autonomous status after the 1991 Gulf War. Allegations of fraud, also being leveled by the main opposition Gorran Movement, will unsettle Kurds who hoped the poll would end turbulence and deliver stability. Veteran KDP leader Masoud Barzani has managed to retain a support base even though he led an independence bid that brought hardship for the Kurds after military and economic retaliation from Baghdad. Splits within the PUK could give the KDP the upper hand in their power-sharing arrangement, which has been fraught with tensions. The two sides fought a civil war in the 1990s. The Kurdish election commission issued instructions overnight to voters on what type of identification is required for voting, in an attempt to prevent fraud, it said.  In a statement, Gorran accused the PUK of “taking measures that are a serious threat to the credibility of the parliamentary election” such as forcing election administrators to allow people to vote with fraudulent certificates. PUK officials were not immediately available for comment.

REUTERS/Azad LashkariElection observers and Reuters correspondents noted irregularities.  In one example, three political party observers told Reuters a group of 30 men carrying knives barged into a polling center in Sulaimaniya and demanded to vote, even though they did not have the required documents. The men, whose loyalties were unclear, stormed a voting room, broke open ballot boxes and walked off with the ballots, said the observers.  While criticism of the ruling Kurdish establishment  -  dominated for decades by the Barzani and the Talabani families - has grown more vocal, a struggling opposition has been unable to alter the political landscape or influence policies.  “I don’t know who I will vote for, but our family has always supported the KDP. My son will pick a candidate for me,” said Halima Ahmed, 65, as she walked with a cane in the city of Erbil, the seat of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Preliminary results are expected within 72 hours. There are 111 seats being contested in the election, including 11 reserved for ethnic minorities.  LOW PARTICIPATION Reuters correspondents who visited several polling stations in the main cities of Erbil and Sulaimaniya throughout the day noted low turnout. “The participation rate is very weak,” said lawyer and independent observer Belnd Omar. The number of voters has shrunk in recent elections as the region’s stagnant politics, unpaid public sector salaries and corruption have undermined the population’s faith in politics. Kurdish opposition parties did poorly when Iraq held federal elections in May. But multiple allegations that the KDP and PUK had committed election fraud  - not confirmed in a subsequent recount - may sway some voters in their favor.   Gorran, the main opposition movement, has been hit by infighting and the death of its founder and leader Nechirvan Mustafa last year. The disarray has not discouraged some Kurds who are tired of the status quo.   “If there’s no fraud in this election, I’ll feel good about it. But the parties in power always want to commit fraud, it’s the only way they stay in power,” said lawyer Hassan Dalloush, 65, in the PUK stronghold of Sulaimaniya.

190,Indonesia mourns as death toll from quake jumps to 832,"The toll from an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia soared to 832 confirmed dead on Sunday, with authorities fearing the numbers will climb as rescuers grappled to get aid to outlying communities cut off from communications and help. Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the city of Palu, on Sulawesi island, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. A woman was pulled alive from the debris of the city’s Roa Roa Hotel, where up to 60 people were believed trapped. Hundreds of people gathered at the wrecked eight-storey Tatura Mall searching for loved ones. “Grieve for the people of Central Sulawesi, we all grieve together,” President Joko Widodo tweeted late on Sunday. Most of the confirmed deaths were in Palu itself, and authorities are bracing for the toll to climb as connections with outlying areas are restored.  Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, which has been cut off from communications since Friday. (For a map of Sulawesi, click tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD) “We haven’t received reports from the three other areas. Communication is still down, power is still out. We don’t know for sure what is the impact,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a news conference. Along with Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, these districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. A video of the outskirts of Donggala shot on Sunday afternoon by the Indonesian Red Cross showed scenes of devastation, with houses flattened into piles of rubble and broken furniture. Smaller aftershocks from Friday’s quake continued to rumble through the area.  Social worker Lian Gogali tweeted from the area that several villages on the west coast of Sulawesi were in desperate need of food, medicine and shelter and that road access was still limited. PLEDGE TO REBUILD Five foreigners - three French, one South Korean and one Malaysian - were among the missing, Nugroho said. The 832 dead included people crushed in the quake and swept away by the tsunami. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll could rise into the thousands. Earlier President Widodo visited a housing complex flattened when the quake liquefied the soil it stood on, and called for patience. “I know there are many problems that need to be solved in a short time, including communications,” he said. The ruins would be rebuilt, he said, as aftershocks rattled the region 48 hours after the quake.

Antara Foto/Muhammad Adimaja/ via REUTERSFootage of the ruined city show a crumpled mess of houses, cars and trees mashed together by the quake, with rooftops and roads split and left at all angles. “There are estimated to be many victims in this area. Evacuation is difficult because many collapsed houses are buried in soil,” the National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s Nugroho said on Sunday evening. Internal Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo, asked about reports of looting on social media, said he had ordered authorities to help people get food and drink and businesses would be compensated. One video posted on YouTube showed people grabbing boxes of supplies from a truck. Television pictures showed scores of residents shouting “we’re hungry, we need food” as soldiers distributed rations from a truck in one neighborhood, while footage from elsewhere showed people making off with clothes and other items from a wrecked mall. State logistics agency chief Budi Waseso said it was preparing to send hundreds of tonnes of government rice stocks to Central Sulawesi areas affected by the disaster.   Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government had allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for disaster recovery, media reported. QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNINGS Indonesia, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday. Nugroho, bemoaning a fall in funding, said no tsunami buoys, one type of instrument used to detect the waves, in Indonesia had been operating since 2012. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. But officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu’s beach when the water surged. A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph). Video on social media showed water bearing whirls of debris rushing in as people shouted in alarm and scattered. Palu is at the head of a bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had “amplified” the wave as it was funneled toward the city, a geophysics agency official said. The BMKG said its closest tidal gauge sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an “insignificant” 6 cm (2.5 inches) wave. Palu’s airport was damaged in the quake, but had reopened for limited commercial flights, authorities said.      Neighbors including Australia, Thailand and China offered help and Pope Francis, speaking to thousands in St. Peter’s Square, said he was praying for the victims. The European Union has announced 1.5 million euros ($1.74 million) in immediate aid.  Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population but also significant pockets of Christians, including on Sulawesi, which is one of the archipelago nation’s five main islands.

The United States announced on Friday it will effectively close the consulate following increasing threats from Iran and Iran-backed militia, including rocket fire.  Pompeo, as he explained the move, renewed a warning that the United States would hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans and U.S. diplomatic facilities. “I have made clear that Iran should understand that the United States will respond promptly and appropriately to any such attacks,” Pompeo said in a statement.

197,U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads',"A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad speaks to the media in front of his residence in Beijing, China June 28, 2017.  REUTERS/Thomas PeterU.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa’s biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies. Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China. While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other’s imports. China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said. Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses. China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.” “In disseminating its propaganda, China’s government is availing itself of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote. “In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote. He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper. ",Politik,2018-09-30 00:00:00,Reuters
198,U.S. warship sails near disputed South China Sea islands: U.S. official,"A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Sunday, a U.S. official told Reuters, potentially angering Beijing at a time of tense relations between the two countries. An aerial view of uninhabited island of Spratlys in the disputed South China Sea, April 21, 2017.   REUTERS/Erik De CastroBeijing and Washington are locked in a trade war that has seen them impose increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other’s imports. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the destroyer Decatur traveled within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson Reefs in the Spratly Islands.  The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate. China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. “We conduct routine and regular freedom-of-navigation operations, as we have done in the past and will continue to do in the future,” the U.S. official added. China’s foreign ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The United States has criticized China’s construction of islands and military facilities in the area and is concerned they could be used to restrict free nautical movement. The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and are separate from political considerations. The latest move comes at a particularly tense time in relations between the United States and China.  Friction between the world’s two biggest economies is now moving beyond trade, with U.S. President Donald Trump accusing Beijing this week of seeking to interfere in congressional elections, marking a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China. China recently denied a request for a U.S. warship to visit Hong Kong and this month Beijing postponed joint military talks in protest against a U.S. decision to impose sanctions on a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system. In May two U.S. Navy warships sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China. ",Weltnachrichten,2018-09-30 00:00:00,Reuters
199,"Fearing debt trap, Pakistan rethinks Chinese 'Silk Road' projects","After lengthy delays, an $8.2 billion revamp of a colonial-era rail line snaking from the Arabian Sea to the foothills of the Hindu Kush has become a test of Pakistan’s ability to rethink signature Chinese “Silk Road” projects due to debt concerns. A cargo train loaded with coal dust, moves past the port area near City Station in Karachi, Pakistan September 24, 2018.  REUTERS/Akhtar SoomroThe rail megaproject linking the coastal metropolis of Karachi to the northwestern city of Peshawar is China’s biggest Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project in Pakistan, but Islamabad has balked at the cost and financing terms. Resistance has stiffened under the new government of populist Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has voiced alarm about rising debt levels and says the country must wean itself off foreign loans. “We are seeing how to develop a model so the government of Pakistan wouldn’t have all the risk,” Khusro Bakhtyar, minister in Pakistan’s planning ministry, told reporters recently. The cooling of enthusiasm for China’s investments mirrors the unease of incoming governments in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Maldives, where new administrations have come to power wary of Chinese deals struck by their predecessors. Pakistan’s new government had wanted to review all BRI contracts. Officials say there are concerns the deals were badly negotiated, too expensive or overly favored China. But to Islamabad’s frustration, Beijing is only willing to review projects that have not yet begun, three senior government officials have told Reuters. China’s Foreign Ministry said, in a statement in response to questions faxed by Reuters, that both sides were committed to pressing forward with BRI projects, “to ensure those projects that are already built operate as normal, and those which are being built proceed smoothly”. Pakistani officials say they remain committed to Chinese investment but want to push harder on price and affordability, while re-orientating the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - for which Beijing has pledged about $60 billion in infrastructure funds - to focus on projects that deliver social development in line with Khan’s election platform. China’s Ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing, told Reuters that Beijing was open to changes proposed by the new government and “we will definitely follow their agenda” to work out a roadmap for BRI projects based on “mutual consultation”. “It constitutes a process of discussion with each other about this kind of model, about this kind of roadmap for the future,” Yao said. Beijing would only proceed with projects that Pakistan wanted, he added. “This is Pakistan’s economy, this is their society,” Yao said. Islamabad’s efforts to recalibrate CPEC are made trickier by its dependence on Chinese loans to prop up its vulnerable economy. Growing fissures in relations with Pakistan’s historic ally the United States have also weakened the country’s negotiating hand, as has a current account crisis likely to lead to a bailout by the International Monetary Fund, which may demand spending cuts. “We have reservations, but no other country is investing in Pakistan. What can we do?” one Pakistani minister told Reuters.    CRUMBLING RAILWAYS The ML-1 rail line is the spine of country’s dilapidated rail network, which has in recent years been edging towards collapse as passenger numbers plunge, train lines close and the vital freight business nosedives. Khan’s government has vowed to make the 1,872 km (1,163 mile) line a priority CPEC project, saying it will help the poor travel across the vast South Asian nation. A passenger train moves past labourers working on a railway track along City Station in Karachi, Pakistan September 24, 2018.  REUTERS/Akhtar SoomroBut Islamabad is exploring funding options for CPEC projects that depart from the traditional BRI lending model - whereby host nations take on Chinese debt to finance construction of infrastructure - and has invited Saudi Arabia and other countries to invest. One option for ML-1, according to Pakistani officials, is the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model, which would see investors or companies finance and build the project and recoup their investment from cashflows generated mainly by the rail freight business, before returning it to Pakistan in a few decades time. Yao, the Chinese envoy, said Beijing was open to BOT and would “encourage” its companies to invest. Rail mega-projects under China’s BRI umbrella have run into problems elsewhere in Asia. A line linking Thailand and Laos has been beset by delays over financing, while Malaysia’s new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad outright canceled the Chinese-funded $20 billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL). Beijing is happy to offer loans, but reticent to invest in the Pakistan venture as such projects are seldom profitable, according to Andrew Small, author of a book on China-Pakistan relations. “The problem is that the Chinese don’t think they can make money on this project and are not keen on BOT,” said Small. OFF-BOOKS DEBT During President Xi Jinping’s visit to Pakistan in 2015, the ML-1 line was placed among a list of “early harvest” CPEC projects that would be prioritized, along with power plants urgently needed to end crippling electricity shortages. But while many other projects from that list have now been completed the rail scheme has been stuck. Pakistani officials say they became wary of how early BRI contracts were awarded to Chinese firms, and are pushing for a public tender for ML-1. Partly to help with price discovery, Pakistan asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance a chunk of the rail project through tendering. The ADB began discussions on a $1.5-2 billion loan, but China insisted the project was “too strategic”, and Islamabad kicked out the ADB under pressure from Beijing in early 2017, according to Pakistani and ADB officials. “If it’s such a strategic project then it should be a viable project for them to finance on very concessional terms or invest in?” said one senior Pakistani official familiar with the project, referring to the BOT model. China’s foreign ministry said Beijing was engaged in “friendly consultations” with Pakistan on the rail project. Chinese companies participated in BRI projects in an open and transparent way, “pooling benefits and sharing risks”, it said.  Analysts say Pakistan will struggle to attract non-Chinese investors into the project, which may force it to choose between piling on Chinese debt or walking away from the project. In 2017, Pakistan turned down Chinese funding for a $14 billion mega-dam project in the Himalayas due to cost concerns and worries Beijing could end up owning a vital national asset if Pakistan could not repay loans, as occurred with a Sri Lankan port. Khan’s government chafes at several Chinese intercity mass transport projects in Punjab, the voter heartland of the previous government, which now need hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies every year.  They also fume about the risk of accumulating off-books sovereign debt through power contracts, where annual profits of above 20 percent, in dollar terms, were guaranteed by the previous administration. With the ML-1 line, there are also those who harbor doubts closer to home, including the previous government’s finance minister, Miftah Ismail, who said his ministry had always had concerns about its viability. “When people say it’s a project of national importance, that usually means it makes no sense financially,” he said.

200,North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust,"North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.   Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology. “However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.,” he said. “Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.” While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past. Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea’s security. North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first. Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea. “The U.S. insists on the ‘denuclearization-first’ and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war,’” Ri said. “The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us. But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.” Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week. The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock.” DIFFERENT TONE      Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea’s rockets was inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission. This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.   On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying “If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn’t matter.” China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken. However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization.” The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would  visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit. Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well. He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making “gangster-like demands.” North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.” Moon told an event in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting that declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War would encourage North Korea to move further with denuclearization. He said Kim had told him the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.

202,FBI contact second accuser of court nominee Kavanaugh,"FBI agents investigating U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have contacted the second woman to accuse him of sexual misconduct, her attorney said on Saturday. The announcement by Deborah Ramirez’s lawyer John Clune indicates that the FBI probe of Kavanaugh will look beyond separate allegations of attempted rape leveled against the conservative federal appeals court judge by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing this week. Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party at a Yale University dormitory when they were undergraduates. Kavanaugh denies both Ford’s and Ramirez’s allegations. “We can confirm the FBI has reached out to interview Ms. Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate with their investigation,” Clune said in a tweet. “Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time.” U.S. President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI investigation after Thursday’s Senate hearing, during which Ford, a California university professor, detailed her claims that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when the two were still high school teenagers. On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had constrained the FBI investigation by limiting its parameters. Trump denied that story, tweeting that “Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion.” White House spokesman Raj Shah said the Senate had set the “scope and duration” of the FBI probe, which is supposed to be wrapped up in a week. “The White House is letting the FBI agents do what they are trained to do,” Shah said. Michael Avenatti, the attorney for a third Kavanaugh accuser, Julie Swetnick, said in an email to Reuters that his client has not been contacted by investigators. If confirmed to a lifetime Supreme Court appointment, Kavanaugh would consolidate conservative control of the nation’s highest court and advance Trump’s effort to shift the American judiciary to the right.

203,Trump uses Kavanaugh delay as rallying cry for midterm elections,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday used the stalled nomination of his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as a rallying cry for Republican voters in November congressional elections. At a West Virginia rally, Trump did not say a word about the testimony of university professor Christine Blasey Ford who detailed her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh at an extraordinary hearing on Thursday. After that hearing, Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to further investigate. Trump told supporters, who packed a hockey rink to the rafters for a raucous and freewheeling speech, that the delay showed why they need to vote against “mean and nasty and untruthful” Democrats in the Nov. 6 midterms. “I will tell you, he has suffered. The meanness, the anger,” Trump said. Trump was campaigning in a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election to try to boost support for Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in polls behind Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. President Donald Trump makes remarks at WesBanco Arena during a Make America Great Again rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, September 29, 2018.            REUTERS/Mike TheilerManchin is one of a handful of senators seen as key swing votes on Kavanaugh’s appointment. It was the first of five rallies for Trump this week to energize supporters and volunteers ahead of Nov. 6 congressional elections, where Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress. “A lot of what we’ve done - some people could say all of what we’ve done - is at stake in November,” Trump said, urging supporters to get involved. “We are just five weeks away from one of the most important congressional elections in our lifetimes,” he said. Kavanaugh’s troubled confirmation has disappointed conservative voters and energized Democrats. Trump touted a poll done in West Virginia after the Senate hearing by the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative activist group that is backing Kavanaugh with a $1.5 million ad campaign. The polling showed 58 percent of voters in the state want the confirmation to go ahead, while 28 percent are opposed.

204,"At U.S. Marine base, families plead for housing help after Florence","CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. Two weeks after Hurricane Florence devastated parts of the U.S. Southeast with raging waters and dangerous winds, some military families at the region’s largest Marine Corps base say they are still residing in unlivable conditions and awaiting help from the base’s private housing manager. Jennifer Maher, pregnant in her third trimester, prepares cleaning supplies in an attempt to clean up mold after suffering severe damage to her home post-Hurricane Florence at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, U.S., September 27, 2018.  REUTERS/Andrea JanutaSome, like Jennifer Maher, said they feel unsafe in their Camp Lejeune homes but were told they will not be moved because assessment crews determined their houses are habitable. Previously from Reuters: Special Report: Children poisoned by lead on U.S. Army bases as hazards ignored Senators demand answers from Army after Reuters report on lead poisoning That did not work for Maher, pregnant in her third trimester and living with her husband and 2-year-old son. When she returned home last Friday, she opened the door to the stench of mold, she said while showing the wreckage to a visiting reporter. Then she saw the ceiling had collapsed in their bedroom and garage. “I’m pregnant and I can smell the mold,” said Maher, whose husband is a Navy corpsman stationed at Lejeune. “There’s no way I could bring a newborn home and let her breathe this in.” Though an assessment crew noted the collapsed ceilings and standing water, Maher said, the housing manager told the family they would not be relocated. After she threatened to complain to the Inspector General’s office on base, she said her family was given temporary lodging. She is considering breaking her lease, since she does not know if her home will be repaired before she is moved out of the temporary place. “I understand they have a lot to take care of,” Maher said of the housing manager. “But it’s hard when your housing company says, ‘I don’t know what to tell you, go find a shelter.’” Other families shared similar stories this week with Reuters, as the Marine Corps and the base’s private housing companies perform triage from the fallout from Florence. A reporter visited the base, speaking with three residents in their damaged homes and interviewing two others, one off base and one by phone. This year, Reuters has been examining safety and environmental hazards faced by U.S. military families on military bases, including cases of childhood lead poisoning. At Lejeune, some families described encountering troubles that reporters observed at other bases: lags in maintenance responses by private contractors that stir worries over health. Most of Camp Lejeune’s housing is run by Atlantic Marine Corps Communities, or AMCC, a partnership between Australia-based LendLease Group LLC.AX, Boston-based WinnCompanies and the U.S. Navy. All the homes profiled in this story are managed by AMCC. “Residents have multiple options to raise concerns to AMCC management and military leadership if they have persistent issues that are not addressed,” AMCC said on Saturday, in a statement provided through Marine Corps public affairs specialist Victoria Long. According to Long, the Marine Corps Inspector General office for the region has received one complaint about housing issues related to Florence, but discovered AMCC had resolved the issue when it followed up. ‘ASKING FOR PATIENCE’ Of the more than 4,600 homes the company operates at Camp Lejeune and nearby New River Air Station, 1,200 have undergone assessments. The inspections found 82 homes uninhabitable and requiring relocation, said 2nd Lieutenant Andrew Martino, a communications officer at Camp Lejeune. Another 267 suffered sustained damage but were habitable. A further 560 homes are operated by a different manager, Lincoln Military Housing, which has not reported serious damage, he said. “Assessments are ongoing,” Martino said. “We’re just asking for patience around the base.” AMCC said it has finished exterior assessments of all neighborhoods and expects to complete initial visual assessments of all home interiors by Oct. 5. It estimates 70 percent of its North Carolina inventory has experienced damage, and that repairs will take several weeks to many months. Around 75 percent of families in the most severely damaged homes have been relocated, it said. On its website, AMCC acknowledges many of its neighborhoods suffered widespread damage. The company is allowing families to break leases without penalty through Oct. 13, but is not guaranteeing alternative housing on base unless homes are deemed uninhabitable, its website says. “One of our top priorities is currently assessing the damage that has occurred as a result of Hurricane Florence,” the website says. “Damages will be prioritized for safety, with the most severe and pressing cases being addressed first.” A collapsed ceiling is shown in the house of a Marine and his family whose home suffered severe damage post-Hurricane Florence at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, U.S., September 27, 2018. REUTERS/Andrea JanutaCivilian areas, too, are struggling to recover. An estimated 8,000 or more homes in the Carolinas suffered major damage, according to the American Red Cross. Read more: Senators seek review of lead in military housing, citing Reuters Exclusive: U.S. Army forms plan to test 40,000 homes for lead Army mobilizes against lead hazards at bases around globe At Camp Lejeune, the base held community meetings this week to address resident concerns. Phone lines, shut down earlier, have come back online. But some residents say they have received few answers about their problems. Another expectant mother, Paige Schneider, said AMCC told her a collapsed ceiling and mold in her home were not enough to require a move. Schneider said she told housing officials she was due within a month, and that the mold was dangerous for a newborn. Excessive exposure to mold can pose a potential health hazard. An AMCC employee, Schneider said, suggested she and her husband remove the mold themselves. She opted to take refuge with a friend. She was only given alternative base housing on Thursday, 13 days after the storm, when a doctor intervened. The doctor provided a letter, reviewed by Reuters, recommending that she be moved or that the property manager remove the mold. The living conditions, the doctor wrote, are “unsafe for her or her family to reside there throughout her pregnancy or to bring a newborn home to such conditions.” “It’s crazy it had to get that far for anything to happen,” Schneider said. HUNKERED DOWN As residents of coastal North Carolina prepared for Hurricane Florence’s arrival earlier this month, Camp Lejeune’s commander, Brigadier General Julian Alford, decided not to order service members and their families to evacuate. He told residents in a Facebook post he believed the base offered strong shelter in the face of a hurricane. Most of the base is not in a flood-prone area, he noted, and the base has withstood many big storms in its 77-year history. Many families left anyway, paying out of pocket for hotels inland or scattering farther away to stay with family and friends. “Non-essential personnel were given the option to evacuate and are now being reimbursed for some of their expenses,” said Nat Fahy, a Camp Lejeune spokesman. No deaths were reported at the base. But some residents returned to find home ceilings caved in, drywall strewn throughout, standing water in bedrooms, and a coating of mold covering their belongings. Some homes went up to a week without power. Onesja Johnson is waiting for her initial assessment. When she returned to the base over a week ago, she said she visited the housing office to say her ceiling was falling in and the mold made it hard for her to breathe. Johnson is sleeping on the couch, while her husband is deployed. She said her mattress is soaked through. Though she was told by the housing office that someone would come by to put a tarp on her roof, no one has yet, she said. “I honestly have no idea what’s going on.” She is not alone. After returning to a kitchen infested with roaches and a mattress covered in mold, Sombra Torres and her husband were initially sleeping in their living room and eating take-out food. Sombra, also pregnant, slept on a loveseat, while her husband improvised a bed from military gear on the floor. After two days, she said, she began to feel ill and stayed with a friend. “I’m unable to get ahold of anybody” at AMCC, she said. “I’ve called many times and haven’t been able to get through.” In its statement, AMCC estimated it will finish covering roofs with tarps by Monday. During the storm and for several days after, “communication lines were down and electronic capability was limited to receive residents’ requests,” but has since been restored, it said. “It is possible that families with concerns were unable to reach AMCC during the storm and for several days after.” Slideshow (7 Images)",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-09-29 00:00:00,Reuters
205,"Musk to resign as Tesla chairman, remain as CEO in SEC settlement","Tesla Inc and Elon Musk have agreed to pay $20 million each to financial regulators and the billionaire will step down as the company’s chairman but remain as chief executive, under a settlement that caps a tumultuous two months for the carmaker.  The securities fraud agreement, disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday, will come as a relief to investors, who had worried that a lengthy legal fight would only further hurt the loss-making electric car company. The SEC on Thursday charged Musk, 47, with misleading investors with tweets on Aug. 7 that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had secured funding. The tweets had no basis in fact, and the ensuring market chaos hurt investors, it claimed.         Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been bruised by Musk’s recent behavior, which included smoking marijuana and wielding a sword on a webcast, and attacking a British rescue diver via Twitter.  The settlement should place more oversight on Musk while not taking the “devastating” measure of forcing him out, said Steven Heim, a director at Boston Common Asset Management, which owns shares in Tesla battery maker Panasonic Corp.  Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board committee to set controls over Musk’s communications under the proposed agreement. “The prompt resolution of this matter on the agreed terms is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including the shareholders of Tesla,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement. Thursday’s charges shaved about $7 billion off high-flying Tesla, knocking its market value to $45.2 billion on Friday, below General Motors Co’s $47.5 billion.  In the settlement, the agency pulled back from its demand that Musk, who is synonymous with the Tesla brand, be barred from running Tesla, a sanction that many investors said would be disastrous.       “I think this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who rates Tesla “neutral” and who called the SEC’s penalty “a slap on the wrist” for Musk.  “The fact that he can remain CEO is very important for the company.” Verwandte ThemenSEC chairman says Tesla settlement in 'best interests' of shareholdersNeither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC’s findings as part of the settlement, which still must be approved by a court. Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. HUNT FOR A STRONG CHAIR? Musk had been directly involved in almost every detail of Tesla’s product design and technology strategy, and drove the company’s employees to extraordinary achievements - much as another Silicon Valley chief executive, Steve Jobs, did at Apple Inc.  The entrepreneur is now required to step down as chairman of Tesla within 45 days, and he is not permitted to be re-elected to the post for three years.   The SEC charged Tesla with failing to have required disclosure controls and procedures for Musk’s tweets. The SEC said the company had no way to determine if his tweets contained information that must be disclosed in corporate filings, or if they contained complete and accurate information. Musk walked away at the last minute from an earlier settlement with the SEC that would have required him to give up key leadership roles at the company for two years and pay a nominal fine, according to media reports on Friday. Reuters on Friday reported that Musk could settle with the SEC but was ready for a court fight.   Investors said on Friday that it has been a mistake for Musk to turn down that settlement, especially at a time when the company has been pushing hard to meet aggressive production targets for its Model 3 sedan. The settlement tasks the Tesla board, which critics have accused of failing to rein in Musk, with the tricky challenge of finding an independent chairman able to work closely with the sometimes unpredictable chief executive.  It was not immediately clear who would be appointed to the role. Antonio Gracias, the current lead independent director and CEO of Valor Equity Partners, has been criticized as being too close to Musk and his companies.  “The question is whether Musk’s buddies on the board decide to bring in a really strong chair who will stand up to Musk,” said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows corporate governance. Musk has driven the company to the verge of profitability with a costly ramp-up of production of its Model 3 over the past year. Electric vehicle news site Electrek reported that Tesla had produced 51,000 Model 3s with a couple of days left in the quarter, hitting its goal of 50,000 to 55,000. The CEO, who has often turned to Twitter to promote Tesla and confront critics, said on Thursday that the SEC’s actions were unjustified. Tesla shares jumped after his Aug. 7 tweets, a blow to short-sellers betting on the stock’s decline.  As the public face of Tesla, Musk had gained legions of fans for his bold approach to business and technology. He used his Twitter account to promote the achievements of Tesla, his rocket launch company SpaceX, and other projects such as his tunnel venture, the Boring Co, to his nearly 23 million followers.

206,"Canada, U.S. make progress in bid to save NAFTA, no deal yet: sources","Canada and the United States on Saturday narrowed their differences in last-ditch talks to save NAFTA but there is no guarantee an agreement will be forged, two Ottawa sources said, a notion echoed by a top adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. FILE PHOTO: The flags of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. are seen on a lectern before a joint news conference on the closing of the seventh round of NAFTA talks in Mexico City, Mexico, March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File PhotoThe two nations are trying to find a way to update the North American Free Trade Agreement and prevent it from collapsing. The 1994 pact underpins $1.2 trillion in annual trade and its demise would be enormously damaging, say economists. Trump is threatening to impose auto tariffs on Canada unless it signs a text of an updated agreement by the end of Sunday. Washington already has a deal with Mexico, the third member of NAFTA. In a sign of the mounting pressure, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her country’s annual address to the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday to return to Ottawa. Freeland, who has spent many days in Washington over the last month, has no plans to fly back immediately, officials say. The two sides are talking continuously by phone and a Canadian government source said the tone of the negotiations was positive and intense. “The fact talks are still going on shows there are issues to be settled. A deal is not necessarily going to happen,” said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. Trump’s trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro, speaking on Saturday to Fox News, struck an upbeat tone on the progress of talks.  “Most of the big issues are solved with Canada,” Navarro said, adding it would be “a great deal for all three countries.”  Trump blames NAFTA for causing U.S. manufacturing jobs to move to low-wage Mexico and is demanding major changes. “We’ll see what happens with Canada, if they come along. They have to be fair,” Trump said on Saturday during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, complaining about Canada’s dairy tariffs, which have been a particularly sore point for him. “We’ve made the deal with Mexico, and it’s a great deal for both countries,” Trump said. The office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment on Saturday’s talks. A spokesman for USTR did not respond to requests for comment on the talks. A second Ottawa source said the two sides were still trying to resolve disagreements over a dispute resolution mechanism that Canada says is vital and the United States wants to scrap. In exchange for a compromise on the mechanism, Ottawa is set to bow to a U.S. demand to offer significantly more access to Canada’s protected dairy market, said the source. A third source familiar with the negotiations said the idea of a link between dispute resolution and dairy access was not currently being discussed.  Opening up the dairy market could cause problems for Trudeau, since the influential farming industry opposes the idea. The Dairy Farmers of Canada lobby group did not respond to a request for comment. Sources familiar with the talks told Reuters on Sept. 11 that Canada was ready to give the United States limited dairy access. Ottawa has offered farmers compensation to make up for conceding market share in two earlier trade agreements. Automaker executives briefed on the plans said Saturday they expect a final deal similar to the one reached with Mexico that would effectively cap Canadian vehicle and auto parts exports at a level around 40 to 50 percent higher than existing imports. The agreement would allow the United States to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on vehicles above the cap. The USTR’s office reached out to automakers over the weekend to seek input about how the cap will work and how the vehicle quota will be apportioned, an auto industry executive briefed on the matter said. One big uncertain question for U.S. and foreign automakers is whether U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel will be lifted. A NAFTA deal had looked unlikely on Wednesday when, after a month of slow-moving discussions, Trump indicated he was fed up with Trudeau, who has insisted he will not sign a bad deal. But late on Thursday, U.S. officials reached out to Canada to ask for details of Ottawa’s negotiating demands and where it might be able to make compromises, Reuters reported. Trump is under increasing pressure from U.S. business groups and some members of the U.S. Congress, who say excluding Canada from NAFTA would play havoc with the three member nations’ increasingly integrated economies.

Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (L), and Democratic U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke hold their first debate for Texas U.S. Senate seat at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, U.S., September 21, 2018.   Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News/Pool via REUTERS  At Southern Methodist University in Dallas, the two battled over hot-button issues such as immigration, gun rights and trade. O’Rourke frequently complained that Cruz was misrepresenting his positions — at one point accusing the incumbent Republican of “slander.”  The candidates sparred as well over the embattled Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who faces allegations that he assaulted a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, while both were in high school. Cruz urged Ford to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Cruz is a member, next week. “The allegations she has raised are serious, and they deserve to be treated with respect,” Cruz said. “Judge Kavanaugh deserves a full opportunity to defend himself,” he added. O’Rourke, a U.S. representative from El Paso, called for the FBI to investigate Ford’s claims, something that Senate Republicans have resisted, and argued that Kavanaugh’s nomination should be rejected.  Cruz painted O’Rourke, who favors a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, opposes building a wall along the border with Mexico, and supports some gun-control measures, as too radical for Texas. He noted that O’Rourke has expressed an openness toward abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency and impeaching President Donald Trump. O’Rourke in turn blasted Cruz for supporting massive deportations of illegal immigrants. “Imagine the cost,” O’Rourke said. “Imagine the stain on our conscience.”  U.S. Sen.

Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News/Pool via REUTERS  He also slammed Cruz for supporting Trump’s trade policies, which he said have negatively impacted the Texas economy. The state “needs a senator who will work with the president where we can and stand up to him where we must,” O’Rourke said.  Following the debate, O’Rourke told reporters that Cruz “has a tendency to mischaracterize a position” and was making him appear more politically more radical than he is.  Asked to respond, Cruz spokeswoman Emily Miller said the debate was the first time O’Rourke “has been directly confronted with his policies.” Cruz, who is seeking a second term in the Senate, did not address the media after the debate. The two candidates will square off twice more before election day. The Nov. 6 elections will determine whether Republicans will retain control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Democrats need to win a net total of two additional seats to take the Senate and 23 to assume the majority in the House.  If Democrats win control of either chamber, much of Trump’s agenda would be stymied and his administration would be subjected to greater scrutiny. O’Rourke’s candidacy was once viewed as the longest of long shots. Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1988. But O’Rourke has focused heavily on courting women, Latinos and young voters, has developed a strong following on social media, and has proven to be a fund-raising dynamo, outpacing Cruz’s efforts.  A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll gave O’Rourke a slight edge, with 47 percent to Cruz’s 45 percent That came on the heels of a Quinnipiac University survey that showed Cruz up by 9 percentage points.

211,California governor signs gun control bills into law,"California Governor Jerry Brown signed several gun control bills into law on Friday, including one measure that raises the minimum age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21.  The new laws come seven months after a gunman opened fire with a semiautomatic assault-style rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 14 students and three adults, the second-deadliest mass shooting at a public school in U.S. history. The rampage, which authorities say was carried out by a former student who was 19, has spurred unprecedented activism by victims and their families to prevent future gun violence and demanding stricter gun control across the United States. California already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. State Senator Anthony Portantino, the Democrat lawmaker who wrote the bill, said the rampage in Florida along with other shootings at high schools motivated him.  “No parent should have to worry that a gun gets in the wrong hands and commits a heinous and violent tragedy on our school campuses,” he said in a statement.  The new California laws, which go into effect Jan. 1, exempt law enforcement officers and military service members.

He also signed a bill that makes it easier for family members and police to take firearms and ammunition away from people who are believed to be a threat to commit violence.   Three weeks after the shooting in Parkland, Florida lawmakers raised the legal age for buying rifles and imposed a three-day waiting period on all gun sales. The National Rifle Association (NRA) responded by filing a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the new Florida laws, saying they violated Americans’ constitutional rights. “We will continue to oppose gun control measures that only serve to punish law abiding citizens,” wrote Daniel Reid, the director of the NRA in California, in a letter to state lawmakers, according to the Los Angeles Times.

212,Trump heads on five-state rally blitz amid Supreme Court chaos,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday kicks off a week of rallies in five friendly places around the country, seeking to shore up support ahead of congressional elections even as the fate of his pick to fill a Supreme Court vacancy remains unclear. Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in the Nov. 6 elections, which could impede Trump’s goals to clamp down on immigration, cut taxes, approve new bilateral trade deals, and invest in infrastructure. Allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, have complicated his confirmation proceedings, disappointing conservative voters and energizing Democrats. Kavanaugh denies the accusations. Trump travels first to Wheeling, West Virginia, on Saturday, where Republicans are trying to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, one of a handful of senators seen as key swing votes that will determine Kavanaugh’s appointment.  Trump will then hold evening rallies in Johnson City, Tennessee, on Monday; Southaven, Mississippi, on Tuesday; Rochester, Minnesota, on Thursday; and Topeka, Kansas, next Saturday. The Trump campaign said the rallies are aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives. “Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said, declining to be named. A third of the Senate and all House seats are in play. Power could shift if Democrats gain two Senate seats and 23 House seats. Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in recent weeks to West Virginia - a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election - to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing Manchin in polls. “It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University. Trump’s next two rallies will be in states he also won handily in 2016: Tennessee, which he took by more than 20 points, and Mississippi, where he won by 18 points. Tennessee’s former governor, Phil Bredesen, and U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn are in a tight race for a Senate seat held by retiring Republican Bob Corker. In Mississippi, two Republicans and two Democrats are in a special election primary battle for a Senate seat vacated by Republican Thad Cochran. Trump has endorsed Cindy Hyde-Smith, who would need to win 50 percent of the votes to avoid a run-off on Nov. 27. Although Trump narrowly lost Minnesota in 2016, he won in Rochester, where he will be appearing on Thursday to support Republicans, including Karin Housley, who is running for the Senate, hoping to unseat Democrat Tina Smith. Smith was appointed to the seat last year after former Democratic Senator Al Franken resigned after being accused of sexual harassment. In Kansas, a state Trump won by 20 percentage points, he will rally support for Kris Kobach’s gubernatorial campaign. Kobach, who serves as the Kansas secretary of state, advised Trump’s campaign on immigration restrictions and has pushed for more restrictive voting laws. Trump is also slated to stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday to speak to a national convention of electrical contractors about workforce development, a White House official said. The planned speech was first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer. While the Pennsylvania stop has not been organized by Trump’s campaign, the president has been actively campaigning for Republican Representative Lou Barletta, who polls show trailing in his Senate race against Democratic incumbent Bob Casey.

Mississippi Department of Public Safety/Handout via REUTERS   The officers from Brookhaven, less than 60 miles (100 km) south of Jackson, had gone to a house to respond to a report that shots had been fired, Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Warren Strain said in an email. It was not immediately clear what led to the exchange of gunfire between the officers and the suspect. The two officers, Corporal Zack Moak, 31, and Patrolman James White, 35, were transported to a Brookhaven hospital where they were pronounced dead, Strain said in the email. The 25-year-old suspect, Marquis Aaron Flowers, who lives near the house where the shooting took place, was wounded in the gunfight and later taken to a Jackson hospital.  Flowers’ medical condition was not immediately known and it was not clear if he had an attorney. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing. The Brookhaven police chief did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant on Twitter called on people to pray for “the family and loved ones of these fallen heroes.” Slideshow (3 Images)",Inlandsnachrichten,2018-09-29 00:00:00,Reuters
214,Palestinians say seven killed as Israeli troops fire on Gaza protest,"Israeli soldiers shot dead seven Palestinians, including two boys, who were among thousands of people who thronged to the fortified Gaza Strip border on Friday as part of weekly protests launched half a year ago, Gaza health officials said.  Israel’s military said its troops resorted to live fire, and an air strike, after explosive devices and rocks were thrown at them and to prevent breaches of the border fence from the Islamist Hamas-controlled enclave.  Gaza health officials said 505 people had been wounded, 89 of them by gunshots. They identified the dead as males, two of them aged 12 and 14. The boys’ families could not immediately be reached for comment. At least 191 Palestinians have been killed since the Gaza protests began on March 30 to demand the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel’s founding in 1948, and the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian economic blockade. Hamas said Friday’s protest also marked the 18th anniversary of the launch of the last Palestinian revolt against Israel.  A Gaza sniper has killed one Israeli soldier and incendiary devices flown over by Palestinians using kites and helium balloons have set off fires that destroyed tracts of forest and farmland in Israel.  Israel accuses Hamas, against which it has fought three wars in the last decade, of having deliberately provoked violence in the protests, a charge Hamas denies. More than two million people are packed into Gaza, whose economic plight is a focus of so-far fruitless U.S.-led efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, stalled since 2014.

216,"U.S. pulls diplomats from Iraqi city, citing threats from Iran","The United States announced on Friday it will effectively close its consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra and relocate diplomatic personnel assigned there following increasing threats from Iran and Iran-backed militia, including rocket fire. The decision adds to mounting tension between the United States and Iran, which is the target of increasing U.S. economic sanctions.  In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said the consulate closure was “unjustified and unnecessary”, and said Iran condemned any attack on diplomats or diplomatic locations, according to the ministry’s website. Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it regretted the decision and urged foreign diplomats not to pay attention to “what is being circulated to undermine the climate of security and stability accompanying Iraq’s relations with the countries of the world.” Iraq is committed to protecting diplomatic missions, spokesman Ahmed Mahgoub said in a statement on Saturday. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as he explained the move, renewed a warning that the United States would hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans and U.S. diplomatic facilities. It followed recent rocket attacks that Pompeo said were directed at the consulate in Basra. U.S. officials said the rockets, however, had not impacted the consulate, which is located on the Basra airport compound. “I have made clear that Iran should understand that the United States will respond promptly and appropriately to any such attacks,” Pompeo said in a statement. Pompeo did not explicitly say whether a U.S. response was imminent, however, and other U.S. officials did not disclose potential response options. Still, Pompeo said the threats against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq were “increasing and specific” and added that Washington was working with Iraqi forces and U.S. allies to address them. “We look to all international parties interested in peace and stability in Iraq and the region to reinforce our message to Iran regarding the unacceptability of their behavior,” he said. ‘CHAOS, DEATH AND DESTRUCTION’ In a statement, the U.S. State Department said the consulate was placed on “ordered departure,” which technically involves a drawdown in staff. Although some personnel could remain on the diplomatic compound, the move is believed to effectively close the consulate, at least temporarily.  The decision came days after U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly, with Trump vowing more sanctions and accusing Iran’s leaders of sowing “chaos, death and destruction.” Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, speaking at a nearby event in New York on Tuesday, warned “there will indeed be hell to pay” if Iran crosses the United States, its allies or harms U.S. citizens. In May, Trump withdrew the United States from an international deal to put curbs on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions.  France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia have stayed in the pact, vowing to save it despite the restoration of U.S. sanctions. The rial has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since April.  Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for the currency’s fall, saying the measures amount to a “political, psychological and economic” war on Tehran, and accused the United States and Israel of involvement in a deadly attack at a military parade in southwestern Iran this month. Basra has already been rocked by violent protests seen by experts as a rejection of the Iraqi political establishment that has held on to power — with the support of the United States and Iran — despite failing to improve people’s lives there. Protesters in Basra ransacked and torched Iraqi government buildings this month and the Iranian consulate was set alight  by demonstrators shouting condemnation of what many see as Iran’s sway over Iraq’s affairs. For the first time in several years, mortar shells also landed this month inside Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses parliament, government buildings and many foreign embassies.

217,"Hundreds killed by Indonesian quake, tsunami, with toll seen rising","At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path. The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta. “The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline. Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations showed waves crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu. Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.    Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD Verwandte ThemenEarthquakes and tsunamis in IndonesiaIndonesia tsunami sensors missed huge waves: officialDEATH TOLL SEEN RISING Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday. The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people. Indonesia’s Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday’s massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two. The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed. A bridge was washed away and the main highway to Palu was cut off due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake. Communications “were totally crippled with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. “We’re now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas. “This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” it said.

Antara Foto/Rolex Malaha via REUTERS Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll could rise to thousands. PRESIDENT TO VISIT DISASTER AREA Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below. Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars. Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts. The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities. The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct. 4 for commercial flights, Nugroho said. The airport’s runway and air traffic control tower were damaged in the quake, authorities said. President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.

218,"Under pressure, Trump orders FBI Kavanaugh probe, causing week delay","President Donald Trump, under intense pressure from moderates in his own party over his Supreme Court nominee, on Friday ordered an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh at the request of Senate Republicans, a move that will delay the contentious confirmation process by a week. The key player in a day of dramatic and unexpected developments was Senator Jeff Flake, a moderate Republican retiring from the Senate in January who provided the decisive vote to approve Kavanaugh’s nomination in the Judiciary Committee and send the matter to the full Senate. But Flake, after urgent consultations with colleagues including Democratic Senator Chris Coons, cast the vote only after asking the Republican-led panel to request that the Trump administration pursue an FBI probe lasting up to seven days of the explosive allegations against Kavanaugh. Trump, who had previously rebuffed Democratic demands for an FBI probe, granted the request, ordering the “supplemental investigation” to be “limited in scope and completed in less than one week.” “Just started, tonight, our 7th FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He will someday be recognized as a truly great Justice of The United States Supreme Court!,” Trump said in a Twitter post late on Friday. Flake’s move came a day after an extraordinary hearing in which university professor Christine Blasey Ford detailed her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Flake’s action also came only hours after two protesters who said they were sexual assault survivors cornered him in an elevator and castigated him for announcing he would vote for Kavanaugh in the committee. “That’s what you’re telling all women in America - that they don’t matter, they should just keep it to themselves,” one of the protesters shouted at Flake, a frequent Trump critic who looked shaken by the encounter. Flake, who had a pained expression when he made his request for an FBI probe in the committee after forcing a brief delay in the scheduled vote, was supported by two other Republican moderates, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, both of whom have not announced whether they would support Kavanaugh.  The allegations against Kavanaugh, with the backdrop of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault that has toppled a succession of powerful men, have riveted the country even as they have imperiled his confirmation chances. Verwandte ThemenSurvivors feel both hope and fear after Kavanaugh hearing, advocates saySenator Flake's journey to defying Trump on Supreme Court nomineeFactbox: Five senators hold keys to Kavanaugh's Supreme Court bidTrump’s nomination of Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, for a lifetime job on the top U.S. court had appeared to be going along smoothly until Ford’s allegation surfaced last week. He has denied her allegation and accusations of sexual misconduct made by two other women. The committee vote followed a jarring and emotional hearing on Thursday in which Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982 when both were high school students in Maryland. Kavanaugh denied the accusation and accused Democrats - who have opposed his nomination from the outset - of a “calculated and orchestrated political hit.” In a statement issued by the White House, Kavanaugh said he would cooperate with the FBI investigation. If confirmed, Kavanaugh would consolidate conservative control of the nation’s highest court and advance Trump’s broad effort to shift the American judiciary to the right. The controversy has unfolded just weeks ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are trying to seize control of Congress from the Republicans. ‘RIPPED APART’ “This country’s being ripped apart here,” Flake told his fellow senators about the nomination fight. “I think we can have a short pause,” he added. “We ought to do what we can to make sure that we do all due diligence with a nomination this important,” Flake said. Even before Flake’s move, it was unclear if Republicans had the votes to confirm Kavanaugh on the Senate floor. Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate, making the votes of Murkowski and Collins crucial. Trump can afford to lose the vote of only one senator in his own party if all the Democrats vote against Kavanaugh and Vice President Mike Pence casts a tie-breaking vote. Trump said Murkowski and Collins must do what they think is right. Moderate Democrats Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who have not yet announced how they will vote on Kavanaugh, also supported Flake’s move. Trump indicated he was sticking with Kavanaugh, saying he has not thought “even a little bit” about replacing him.

Win McNamee/Pool via REUTERSWith tempers flaring, the Judiciary Committee advanced the nomination 11-10 along party lines. The Senate formally moved to open debate on Kavanaugh’s nomination later on Friday in a move agreed to by both parties, setting the stage for a planned final vote on confirmation at the end of next week. “This is a nomination that deserves to move forward,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. Ford’s lawyer, Debra Katz, welcomed the FBI investigation and thanked the senators who pushed for it but decried the limits imposed on it. “A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts,” Katz said. The timing of the panel’s session gave committee members little time to digest Thursday’s remarkable testimony from Kavanaugh and Ford. Trump said he found Ford’s testimony “very compelling” and Kavanaugh’s angry and defiant response “incredible.” Before Flake’s move, committee Republicans voted down a Democratic motion seeking to subpoena Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend who Ford said witnessed the assault. Judge had told the committee in a written statement he does not recall any such incident. He is likely to be central to any FBI probe.  Judge’s lawyer said he would cooperate with the FBI or any other law enforcement agency. As the committee set its vote, some Democrats left the room in protest. “What a railroad job,” Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono said. One Republican, Senator John Kennedy, called Kavanaugh’s confirmation process “an intergalactic freak show.” Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s senior Democrat, called Kavanaugh’s testimony unseemly for a judicial nominee. “This was someone who was aggressive and belligerent. I  have never seen someone who wants to be elevated to the highest court in the country behave in that manner. In stark contrast, the person who testified yesterday and demonstrated a balanced temperament was Dr. Ford,” Feinstein said. The American Bar Association, which earlier endorsed Kavanaugh, and the dean of Yale Law School, which Kavanaugh attended, also called for an FBI probe on Friday, the first indication of the legal profession turning on the nominee. Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote on contentious legal issues if he is confirmed to the nine-member court, with disputes involving abortion, immigration, gay rights, voting rights and transgender troops possibly heading to the court soon. The court begins its next term on Monday. Slideshow (11 Images)",Politik,2018-09-28 00:00:00,Reuters
219,Senator Flake's journey to defying Trump on Supreme Court nominee,"Something happened to U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Flake between being cornered in a Capitol elevator on Friday as two women shouted at him about sexual assault and, hours later, cutting a momentous deal with Democrats to defy President Donald Trump. Flake’s shift from full-throated support for Brett Kavanaugh to demanding an FBI investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against Trump’s Supreme Court nominee was seemingly swift, with Democratic Senator Chris Coons playing a key role. The outcome of the Flake-Coons deal was that Kavanaugh’s path to Senate confirmation for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court will, at minimum, be delayed for a week as the FBI looks into the accusations made against him. The delay, which could be more consequential depending on what the FBI finds, slammed the brakes on Trump and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell’s pledge to “plow right through” to a quick confirmation of Kavanaugh. Flake, a 55-year-old senator from Arizona who is not running for re-election this year, sat through Thursday’s nine-hour Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and testimony by Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of assault, Christine Blasey Ford. Even then, he was noticeably quiet as both witnesses dramatically told their tales: Ford accusing Kavanaugh of assault when they were both high school students in 1982, and Kavanaugh forcefully denying any such thing ever happened. He told reporters in a Capitol hallway, “Just watching the hearing yesterday, the questions and then the reporting on it afterwards. It just, you know, was a sleepless night.”  On Friday morning, Flake announced he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, a decision that gave his fellow Republicans the votes needed to squelch a Democratic uprising against the federal appeals court judge and pave the way for a full Senate debate. Then he headed from his office to a Judiciary Committee meeting on Capitol Hill, where a vote was planned on the nominee. Along the way, he was confronted by two angry women, Maria Gallagher and Ana Maria Archila. For five minutes the two emotionally harangued him as he stood in the corner of an elevator, staring at the floor and looking up occasionally at them with a pained expression as they described their own experiences with sexual assault and pleaded with him not to agree to putting Kavanaugh on the court.  In his remarks to reporters, he said, the encounter in the elevator was only one of many in recent days. “I’ve heard from a lot of people by phone, email, text, walking around the Capitol. ... It has been remarkable over the past week.” Shortly afterward, Flake took his seat in the committee meeting, where Coons soon made some remarks. The Delaware Democrat, also 55, afterward told reporters in the Capitol, “As I was preparing my remarks today, I at one point turned to my counsel and said: ‘Am I trying to make an argument that could possibly persuade my friend, Jeff Flake?’” They decided that he was. Minutes after Coons spoke, Flake walked over to him behind the dais in the committee room and knelt to talk to him. The two then stood and went into an anteroom, where they were joined by other senators, mostly Democrats. Some time later, Flake came back in and dropped a bombshell. He said he would stick to his promise to support Kavanaugh’s nomination in the committee vote, but under one condition: That there be an FBI investigation of Ford’s allegations.  “This country is being ripped apart here. We have to be sure we do due diligence,” he said. One senior Senate aide familiar with the negotiations attributed Flake’s shift to pressure from Coons. “Chris Coons just achieved what no other Democrat could,” the aide said, referring to weeks of Democrats’ demands for a FBI probe being ignored by Republicans. Late on Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to reopen its investigation into Kavanaugh over sexual misconduct allegations, but said the work must be done in less than a week. Sen.

The full Senate must approve Kavanaugh and Republicans hold only a slim majority there. Most Democrats were expected to oppose the nominee. As of yet, there are no clear signs of Republican defections but here are key senators to monitor ahead of any action. REPUBLICANS * Jeff Flake. A frequent Trump critic who will retire from the Senate in January, Flake was complimentary toward Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. However, on Wednesday, after the president’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr. made light of Ford’s allegations on Instagram, Flake replied in a tweet, “This is sickening. No one should make light of this situation,” USA Today reported. * Susan Collins. A moderate who sometimes breaks from party ranks, Collins earlier this week said she wants both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify under oath to the committee. She told reporters that if Kavanaugh has lied about allegations of sexual misconduct, “that would be disqualifying.” It was still unclear on Friday whether Ford would testify. After Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing, Collins said generally positive things about him. In 2017, she voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first nomination to the court. Collins told the Portland Press-Herald in Maine that she was “appalled” by Trump’s tweets on Friday saying that if the attack on Ford had been as bad as she said, it would have been reported. * Lisa Murkowski. Another occasional party renegade, she has promised to be “rigorous” in her review of Kavanaugh. She has not said how she will vote. Collins also backed Gorsuch. * Dean Heller. Heller is the only Republican senator up for re-election on Nov. 6 whose state was won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and he is seen as vulnerable in his race. Trump flew to Las Vegas in Heller’s home state of Nevada on Thursday to campaign for him. Heller said in a statement after meeting with Kavanaugh in July that had “no reservations in confidently supporting him.” * Rand Paul. Another Republican maverick on some issues, Paul said in July he will support Kavanaugh. * Bob Corker. He has clashed with Trump and is not running for re-election but he has described Kavanaugh as a “superb nominee” whom he plans to vote for. On Tuesday, he said in a tweet, “If we don’t hear from both sides on Monday, let’s vote.” * Ben Sasse. Another senator who has clashed with Trump, Sasse has said he will vote for Kavanaugh. DEMOCRATS * Heidi Heitkamp. Facing a re-election campaign in North Dakota, a heavily pro-Trump state, she was one of three Democrats who voted for Gorsuch. On Kavanaugh, she has called for further investigation of Ford’s allegations. * Joe Manchin. Also up for re-election in the pro-Trump state of West Virginia, he says healthcare is his test of whether to support Kavanaugh, whose critics say will rule against Obamacare the first chance he gets on the Supreme Court. Manchin voted for Gorsuch. * Joe Donnelly. Non-committal thus far on Kavanaugh, Donnelly, too, is up for re-election in the red-leaning state of Indiana. On Monday, he said the allegations against Kavanaugh “serious and merit further review.” * Doug Jones. The first Democratic senator elected from Alabama in over 20 years, he must show he can be independent-minded to stay in office. The Kavanaugh vote could be a test.  * Jon Tester. He opposed Gorsuch but has not come down firmly on Kavanaugh. * Bill Nelson.

222,Still work to do before second Trump-Kim summit: Pompeo,"The United States is working to set up a second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but there is still work to do “to make sure conditions are right,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday. “We’re working on it. But there’s still a little bit of work to do left to make sure the conditions are right and that the two leaders are put in a position where we can make substantial progress,” Pompeo told Fox News in an interview. Pompeo told NBC News in a separate interview that he hoped the meeting could take place “before too long,” and that he hoped he himself would get a chance to travel to Pyongyang again to negotiate before that. But he said international sanctions would have to remain on North Korea until it gave up its nuclear weapons, which are a threat to the United States. “Ultimately, that’ll be a decision for the president,” Pompeo said of a second summit between Kim and Trump to follow on from their unprecedented June 12 meeting in Singapore. “I’m hopeful that I’ll get a chance to travel again to Pyongyang to continue to negotiate before too long,” Pompeo said. “And then before too long – and in relatively short order - I hope the two leaders get together again to continue to make progress on this incredible, important issue for the entire world.” Pompeo added to NBC that important steps had been taken at a summit between the two Koreas this week and that while much more worked needed to be done, the United States had the “patience and determination” to achieve its aim. Referring to sanctions, Pompeo said: “Those economic sanctions will remain in place until we get to the end, till we get to that final denuclearization, which Chairman Kim promised President Trump he would undertake.” South Korea President Moon Jae-in said after meeting Kim this week that the North Korean leader wanted a second summit with Trump to hasten denuclearization, but a key goal was declaring an end this year to the 1950-53 Korean War, which halted with an armistice, not a peace treaty. Pompeo said on Wednesday he had invited North Korea’s foreign minister to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week and other Pyongyang officials to Vienna for talks with U.S. nuclear envoy Stephen Biegun. Asked on Thursday if those meetings would take place, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said invitations had been sent and added: “We certainly stand ready to meet if they are able to.” Moon said he and Kim spent most of a three-day summit discussing how to break an impasse and restart nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington, which are at odds over which should come first - denuclearization or ending the war and sanctions. Kim, who recently proposed another summit with Trump, said after the summit that North Korea was willing to “permanently dismantle” key missile facilities in the presence of outside experts, and also its Yongbyon nuclear complex, if the United States took unspecified corresponding action. Kim pledged to work toward the “complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” during two earlier meetings with Moon and his encounter with Trump, but follow-up negotiations on how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered. Washington has called for concrete action and has demanded full disclosure of North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities before satisfying Pyongyang’s key demands.
